    Description:
      'A measurement of charge reversal concentrations for various metal ions (Ag, Ba, Sr, Ni, Mg, Ca, Co, Zn, Cu, Mn, Pb, Cd, La, Ce, Th) using the Stern equation.',
    Abstract:
      'Surface potentials of mixtures of synthetic phosphatides dispersed in uni-univalent electrolyte have been calculated from the limiting molecular areas through use of the Gouy equation. Electrophoretic mobilities of the dispersed particles were measured and used to calculate zeta potentials from the Hehnholtz-Smoluchowski equation. In analogy with several structurally related systems, the ratio (zeta potential/surface potential) was found to be unity at low surface charge density (u < 20,000 e.s.u. cm-z), decreasing progressively at higher surface charge density to a minimum of 0.58. The zeta potential at low surface charge density is appreciably affected by the composition of the fatty acyl substituents to the extent that this determines the cross-sectional area per net negative charge in the bilayer. Charge reversal concentrations have been measured for various metal ions on several phosphatide surfaces differing in charge density. Inserting the conditions for charge reversal into the Stern equation, the standard free energy of adsorption for each cation was calculated and used to obtain a value for the logarithm of the apparent association constant, K\u2019. At an initial surface charge density below 20,000 e.s.u. cm-z, the sequence of values of log K\u2019 was Ag < Ba < Sr < Ni < Mg < Ca < Co < Zn < Cu < Mn < Pb < Cd < La < Ce < Th < UOn. Comparison of log K\u2019 for magnesium, calcium, strontium, and barium as a function of surface charge density suggests that the larger cations are able to form ion triplets at high surface charge density while the smaller cations are unable to do so. The high affinity of U022+ for phosphatide surfaces is also considered. The results obtained are discussed in terms of their potential applicability to several problems of current biochemical interest. ',

      'An investigation of the role of ionized carboxyl groups of proteins of the red blood cell membrane as calcium (Ca2+) receptor sites.',
    Abstract:
      "1. The role of the ionized carboxyl groups of proteins of the erythrocyte membrane as Ca(2+) receptor sites was investigated. A water-soluble carbodi-imide [1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodi-imide methotoluene-p-sulphonate], referred to as carbodi-imide reagent, and glycine methyl ester were used to modify the free carboxyl groups of the membrane. The degree of modification was estimated from amino acid analyses, which showed the amount of glycine incorporated. As the concentration of carbodi-imide reagent was raised (0.1-0.4m) incorporation of glycine increased and Ca(2+) binding decreased by about 77%. At 0.4m-carbodi-imide reagent all of the binding of Ca(2+) to protein was abolished and it was estimated that about 37% of the side-chain carboxyl groups of aspartic acid plus glutamic acid had been blocked by glycine. 2. Acetylation of all of the free amino groups was achieved by incubating the erythrocyte 'ghosts' at pH10.3 with acetic anhydride (10-15mg/10mg of 'ghost' protein). Acetylation increased by 1.5-fold the capacity of the ;ghost' to bind Ca(2+), indicating that the remaining carboxyl groups of aspartic acid and glutamic acid were made available for Ca(2+) binding by this procedure. These findings support the concept that in normal 'ghosts', at pH7.4, Ca(2+) binding to free carboxyl groups is partially hindered by the presence of charged amino groups. 3. Treatment of ;ghosts' with N-acetylneuraminidase, which removed 94% of sialic acid residues, and treatment with 1mm-p-chloromercuribenzoate did not alter Ca(2+) binding. The major effect of 5.8mm-p-chloromercuribenzoate upon 'ghosts' was to cause a solubilization of a calcium-membrane complex, which included about one-third of the ;ghost' protein. The molar ratio of Ca(2+): protein in the solubilized material was the same as that in the intact (untreated) 'ghosts'.",

The human erythrocyte has been shown to be a macropolyanion possessing about lo7 charged groups per cell of which more than 60% are the carboxyl group of Nacetylneuraminic acid; some of the remaining groups at least are the a-carboxyl groups of protein-bound amino acids. The electrokinetic constitution of the human blood platelet is more complex and includes sialic acid carboxyl groups and phosphate groups and at least one other species of unidentified anionogenic groups as well as amino groups.

    Abstract:
      "Purified inside-out vesicles from human erythrocytes were used to investigate the active transport of oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Incubation of vesicles and GSSG in the presence of ATP resulted in the transport of GSSG into the vesicles. When vesicles were incubated with reduced glutathione (GSH), no transport was observed. At GSSG concentrations of less than 5 mM, transport was linear up to 4 hr at 37 degrees C. A Lineweaver-Burk plot of the transport rate as a function of GSSG concentration was biphasic and gave apparent Km values of 0.1 and 7.1 mM. The Km for ATP . Mg in this transport process was 0.63 mM at a GSSG concentration of 20 microM and 1.25 mM at a GSSG concentration of 5 mM. The transport rate at low GSSG concentrations was inhibited by CTP or UTP, which acted as competitive inhibitors of ATP; Ki=0.51 mM. This inhibition may account for the high erythrocyte GSH levels observed in pyrimidine-5'-nucleotidase deficiency, a disorder in which erythrocytic levels of CTP and UTP are elevated.",

    Abstract:
      'We develop a theory of electrophoresis of human erythrocytes that predicts mobilities significantly smaller than those based on the classical Smoluchowski relation. In the classical treatment the charge is assumed to be spread uniformly on the hydrodynamic surface. The present model takes into account that most of the charge, due mainly to sialic acid, is contained in the glycocalyx. The glycocalyx is modeled as a permeable layer of polyelectrolyte molecules anchored to the cell membrane. The charge is assumed to be uniformly distributed throughout this layer. The fluid flow in the layer is treated as being dominated by Stokes friction arising from idealized polymer segments. The Navier-Stokes equations are solved to give the dependence of electroosomotic velocity with distance from the cell surface. An expression for the electrophoretic mobility is obtained which contains two parameters (a) the thickness of the glycocalyx and (b) the mean polymer segment radius. The best fit to experimental data is obtained if these are given the values 75 A and 7 A, respectively. Deviation from experimental data at low ionic strength (less than 0.05 M) occurs. However, this deviation is in the direction one would expect if at low ionic strength the polyelectrolyte layer expands slightly due to decreased charge shielding.',

    Description: 'An evaluation of whether adenosine cAMP modulates ionic permeabilities of nonpolarized cells.',
    Abstract:
      "To evaluate whether adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) modulates ionic permeabilities of nonpolarized cells, as reported in diverse polarized epithelia, relative ionic permeabilities were determined in human red cell ghosts by means of the potential-sensitive fluorescent probe 3,3'-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide. Relative ionic chloride permeability (PCl/PK), but not PNa/PK, was significantly increased in ghosts prepared from normal red blood cells (RBCs) exposed to cAMP analogues or forskolin, with the latter at a concentration that significantly increased intracellular cAMP concentration. As basal RBC cAMP concentrations of untreated uremic subjects were also increased, relative permeabilities of ghosts and unstimulated RBC cAMP concentrations were compared in normal, uremic, and dialyzed subjects, PCl/PK was significantly increased in uremic compared with normal subjects; PNa/PK was not altered. PCl/PK and RBC cAMP concentrations were indistinguishable in normal and dialyzed subjects. Neither the kinetics nor number of Cl(-)-HCO3- antiporters, assessed with the pH-sensitive probe acridine orange and the disulfonic stilbene 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, respectively, were altered in uremic cells. These studies suggest that cAMP modulates ionic chloride permeability via increased chloride conductance of each Cl(-)-HCO3- antiporter or by activation/opening of new or existing channels in RBC membranes.",

      'An investigation of how temperature may perturb the pH in stored red blood cells, thereby moving the system away from the optimal pH for glycolytic function.',
    Abstract:
      'The interaction of temperature and pH in biological systems comprises two components. Temperature change may perturb the pH of solutions, and it may change the pKa of some ionizable groups that are involved in enzyme catalysis. The pH optima of single reactions and whole pathways are therefore temperature sensitive. The pH optimum of glycolysis in human red cells has been investigated only at 37 degrees C. We have measured the effect of temperature on the pH of stored blood suspensions and on the pH optimum of glycolysis in the human red cell. The pH of the cell suspensions in a traditional storage medium was 7.25 +/- 0.2 at 4 degrees C. The pH optimum of glycolysis was high (7.8-8.5) between 15 and 35 degrees C. It can be inferred from our data that human red cells are currently stored at least 0.5 pH units below the pH optimum of glycolysis at 4 degrees C. This suggestion is supported by storage experiments which showed that glycolysis at 4 degrees C was at least 1.5-fold more active at an initial pH of 7.67 versus 7.36. Equations which describe the variation in reaction velocity with pH were fitted to the pH curves for glycolysis in order to identify the ionizable groups that contribute to the effect of pH on glycolysis. It is generally accepted that hexokinase catalyses the rate-limiting step in glycolysis in the human red cell, but none of the ionizable groups implicated correspond to that involved in the hexokinase reaction.',

    Abstract:
      'The effect of electrostatic forces on biological membranes has been observed in connection with the morphological changes of red blood cells. Lopez et al. attributed the biconcave shape to a balance between hydrostatic pressure drop, electrostatic forces, and membrane tension. In the study of membrane spontaneous deformations induced by thermal fluctuations, field strengths within the membrane are also of special importance. In fact, it has been shown that ionic strength influences strongly the stability of the erythrocyte\u2019s membrane. Mathematical methods of hydrodynamic\u2019 stability analysis can be applied in the study of such phenomena as the system response to a small perturbation of the initial configuration of the membrane. For this purpose the initial state of the system must be well specified, knowledge of the potential profile across the membrane being important, as well as knowledge of the influence of certain parameters, such as ionic strength and surface charges, on this profile.',

      'The mechanism of the "ground permeability" of the human erythrocyte membrane for K+ and Na+ was investigated with respect to a possible involvement of a previously unidentified specific transport pathway, because earlier studies showed that it cannot be explained on the basis of simple electrodiffusion. In particular, we analyzed and described the increase in the (ouabain+bumetanide+EGTA)-insensitive unidirectional K+ and Na+ influxes as well as effluxes (defined as "leak" fluxes) observed in erythrocytes suspended in low-ionic-strength media. Using a carrier-type model and taking into account the influence of the ionic strength on the outer surface potential according to the Gouy-Chapman theory (i.e., the ion concentration near the membrane surface), we are able to describe the altered "leak" fluxes as an electroneutral process. In addition, we can show indirectly that this electroneutral flux is due to an exchange of monovalent cations with protons. This pathway is different from the amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchanger present in the human red blood cell membrane and can be characterized as a K+(Na+)/H+ exchanger.',

    Description:
      'Red blood cells stored in AS-1, AS-3, and AS-5 were treated with pyruvate, inosine, phosphate, and adenine to determine the effects of these compounds on the quality of the cells at day 42.',
    Abstract:
      'A study was done to assess the quality of RBCs stored at 4 degrees C in AS-1, AS-3, or AS-5 for 42 days before biochemical modification and freezing. RBCs were stored at 4 degrees C for 42 days in AS-1, AS-3, or AS-5 and then biochemically modified with pyruvate, inosine, phosphate, and adenine solution (Rejuvesol), frozen with 40-percent (wt/vol) glycerol, and stored at -80 degrees C for at least 2 months. The RBCs were deglycerolized by the use of a cell washer (Haemonetics 115), and stored for 24 hours at 4 degrees C in a 0.9-percent sodium chloride and 0.2-percent glucose solution before the autologous transfusion. The mean freeze-thaw-wash recovery process produced RBC recovery values of 85 percent, with the mean 24-hour posttransfusion survival at 75 percent, and the mean index of therapeutic effectiveness at 64 percent for the RBCs stored at 4 degrees C in AS-1, AS-3, or AS-5 for 42 days before biochemical modification and freezing. All the units exhibited normal or slightly higher than normal 2,3 DPG levels after deglycerolization and postwash storage at 4 degrees C for 24 hours. RBCs stored in AS-1, AS-3, or AS-5 at 4 degrees C for 42 days and then biochemically modified with pyruvate, inosine, phosphate, and adenine and glycerolized, frozen, washed, and stored at 4 degrees C for 24 hours before autologous transfusion had acceptable in vitro and in vivo measurements.',

    Description: 'A network-based analysis of regulation in the red blood cell that complements the study of individual regulatory events.',
    Abstract:
      'Reconstruction of cell-scale metabolic networks is now possible. A description of allowable metabolic network functions can be obtained using extreme pathways, which are the convex basis vectors of the solution space containing all steady state flux distributions. However, only a portion of these allowable network functions are physiologically possible due to kinetic and regulatory constraints. Methods are now needed that enable us to take a defined metabolic network and deduce candidate regulatory structures that control the selection of these physiologically relevant states. One such approach is the singular value decomposition (SVD) of extreme pathway matrices (P), which allows for the characterization of steady state solution spaces. Eigenpathways, which are the left singular vectors from the SVD of P, can be described and categorized by their biochemical function. SVD of P for the human red blood cell showed that the first five eigenpathways, out of a total of 23, effectively characterize all the relevant physiological states of red blood cell metabolism calculated with a detailed kinetic model. Thus, with five degrees of freedom the magnitude and nature of the regulatory needs are defined. Additionally, the dominant features of these first five eigenpathways described key metabolic splits that are indeed regulated in the human red blood cell. The extreme pathway matrix is derived directly from network topology and only knowledge of Vmax values is needed to reach these conclusions. Thus, we have implemented a network-based analysis of regulation that complements the study of individual regulatory events. This topological approach may provide candidate regulatory structures for metabolic networks with known stoichiometry but poorly characterized regulation.',

      'A mathematical model used to reconstruct the pathology arising from hereditary glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, which is the most common deficiency in human RBC.',
    Abstract:
      'Cell simulation, which aims to predict the complex and dynamic behavior of living cells, is becoming a valuable tool. In silico models of human red blood cell (RBC) metabolism have been developed by several laboratories. An RBC model using the E-Cell simulation system has been developed. This prototype model consists of three major metabolic pathways, namely, the glycolytic pathway, the pentose phosphate pathway and the nucleotide metabolic pathway. Like the previous model by Joshi and Palsson, it also models physical effects such as osmotic balance. This model was used here to reconstruct the pathology arising from hereditary glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, which is the most common deficiency in human RBC. Since the prototype model could not reproduce the state of G6PD deficiency, the model was modified to include a pathway for de novo glutathione synthesis and a glutathione disulfide (GSSG) export system. The de novo glutathione (GSH) synthesis pathway was found to compensate partially for the lowered GSH concentrations resulting from G6PD deficiency, with the result that GSSG could be maintained at a very low concentration due to the active export system. The results of the simulation were consistent with the estimated situation of real G6PD-deficient cells. These results suggest that the de novo glutathione synthesis pathway and the GSSG export system play an important role in alleviating the consequences of G6PD deficiency.',

    Description: 'A method for assaying the total S-nitrosothiol content of intact red blood cells.',
    Abstract:
      'It is proposed that the bond between nitric oxide (NO) and the Hb thiol Cys-beta(93) (SNOHb) is favored when hemoglobin (Hb) is in the relaxed (R, oxygenated) conformation, and that deoxygenation to tense (T) state destabilizes the SNOHb bond, allowing transfer of NO from Hb to form other (vasoactive) S-nitrosothiols (SNOs). However, it has not previously been possible to measure SNOHb without extensive Hb preparation, altering its allostery and SNO distribution. Here, we have validated an assay for SNOHb that uses carbon monoxide (CO) and cuprous chloride (CuCl)-saturated Cys. This assay is specific for SNOs and sensitive to 2-5 pmol. Uniquely, it measures the total SNO content of unmodified erythrocytes (RBCs) (SNO(RBC)), preserving Hb allostery. In room air, the ratio of SNO(RBC) to Hb in intact RBCs is stable over time, but there is a logarithmic loss of SNO(RBC) with oxyHb desaturation (slope, 0.043). This decay is accelerated by extraerythrocytic thiol (slope, 0.089; P < 0.001). SNO(RBC) stability is uncoupled from O(2) tension when Hb is locked in the R state by CO pretreatment. Also, SNO(RBC) is increased approximately 20-fold in human septic shock (P = 0.002) and the O(2)-dependent vasoactivity of RBCs is affected profoundly by SNO content in a murine lung bioassay. These data demonstrate that SNO content and O(2) saturation are tightly coupled in intact RBCs and that this coupling is likely to be of pathophysiological significance.',

    Abstract:
      'While the potential possibilities of systems biology appear to hold great promise, there are still many challenges to overcome, notably lack of complete characterization of biological components and their interactions and ways to measure these changes experimentally. The comparative simplicity of the human red cell sidesteps much of these challenges. Detailed models of human red cell metabolism have been developed for the last quarter century and continued development of these models has resulted in the ability to make functional phenotype predictions, in silico. Additionally, existing experimental proteomic and metabolomic technologies now provide the capability to perform individualized characterization of erythrocytes. While an experimentally testable systems biology model of most human cells is presently out of reach, it may be achievable with the red cell.',

    Description: 'A review of the effects of inhaled nitric oxide that may be mediated by circulating erythrocytes.',
    Abstract:
      'Early applications of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), typically in the treatment of diseases marked by acute pulmonary hypertension, were met by great enthusiasm regarding the purported specificity of iNO: vasodilation by iNO was specific to the lung (without a change in systemic vascular resistance), and within the lung, NO activity was said to be confined spatially and temporally by Hb within the vascular lumen. Underlying these claims were classical views of NO as a short-lived paracrine hormone that acts largely through the heme groups of soluble guanylate cyclase, and whose potential activity is terminated on encountering the hemes of red blood cell (RBC) Hb. These classical views are yielding to a broader paradigm, in which NO-related signaling is achieved through redox-related NO adducts that endow NO synthase products with the ability to act at a distance in space and time from NO synthase itself. Evidence supporting the biological importance of such stable NO adducts is probably strongest for S-nitrosothiols (SNOs), in which NO binds to critical cysteine residues in proteins or peptides. The circulating RBC is a major SNO reservoir, and RBC Hb releases SNO-related bioactivity peripherally on O2 desaturation. These new paradigms describing NO transport also provide a plausible mechanistic understanding of the increasingly recognized peripheral effects of inhaled NO. An explanation for the peripheral actions of inhaled NO is discussed here, and the rationale and results of attempts to exploit the "NO delivery" function of the RBC are reviewed.',

    Abstract:
      'Conventional automated cell counters cannot accurately count residual red blood cells (rRBCs) that are often present in various blood products. A two-color flow cytometric method (FC) was validated for detecting and enumerating rRBCs in platelets (PLTs) and mononuclear cell (MNC) products. PLT and MNC products for PLTs (CD61-fluorescein isothiocyanate) and rRBC (anti-glycophorin A-phycoerythrin) were double stained, and data were acquired with a flow cytometer. Assay linearity, accuracy, and precision were assessed with a standard-dilution series of rRBCs. This assay was used to determine the rRBCs of apheresis PLTs collected with Trima Accel (Gambro BCT) and MNC products collected with the COBE Spectra (Gambro BCT). The linear range of this assay in PLT and MNC products is 10 to 2000 RBCs per microL (R2=0.994). FC had a mean intraassay coefficient of variation of 11.8 percent at 34 RBCs per microL. A standard clinical hematology analyzer overestimated rRBCs in MNC products by 1.59x10(5)+/-0.7x10(5) RBCs per microL. Apheresis PLTs had a median of 17.4 RBCs per microL, with 99.0 percent containing fewer than 90.0 RBCs per microL. This method for determining rRBCs in blood products is accurate and repeatable with a lower limit of detection adequate to assess currently available blood products. FC should be considered for determining rRBCs in MNC products.',

    Description: 'An investigation of the in vivo antiischemic effects of nitroglycerin on the myocardium.',
    Abstract:
      'We hypothesized that nitroglycerin improves O2 delivery to ischemic tissue by altering erythrocyte rheology and O2 unloading through an increase in bioactive nitric oxide (NO) content. Twelve dogs with resting flow-reducing single-vessel stenosis were studied at rest and during intracoronary infusion of nitroglycerin (0.3 to 0.6 microg.kg(-1).min(-1)). Half the dogs also had occlusion of the remote coronary artery to remove any collateral effects. Systemic and coronary hemodynamics, myocardial blood flow (MBF), whole blood viscosity (WBeta), erythrocyte charge (EC) and mobility (EM), regional myocardial O2 delivery and consumption, and tissue O2 pressure (Po2) were measured. No changes in systemic hemodynamics were seen with nitroglycerin. Despite flow-limiting stenosis, MBF increased significantly in the central 25% of the ischemic bed, which was associated with an approximately 19% decrease in WBeta. There was a good correlation (r=0.87) between the two. The decrease in WBeta was associated with a decrease in EC and an increase in EM (r=0.83). The nitroglycerin-induced increase in tissue Po2 was disproportionate to the increase in MBF, indicating enhanced O2 unloading. Erythrocyte S-nitrosothiol content (reflecting mainly S-nitrosohemoglobin) was significantly higher for blood exposed in vitro to 0.1 micromol/L nitroglycerin or the NO donor SNAP, as compared with control (18.9+/-8.8 and 10.5+/-6.5 versus 2.6+/-0.5x10(-5), P<0.05). The augmented MBF in the ischemic microcirculation during nitroglycerin administration occurs in tandem with increased erythrocyte S-nitrosothiol content, EM, and O2 unloading. These additional microvascular mechanisms may contribute to the powerful antiischemic effects of nitroglycerin, especially during low-flow states.',

Derangements in\n                 SNO signaling are implicated in many disorders relevant to\n                 pulmonary and critical care medicine, including apnea,\n                 hypoxemia, pulmonary hypertension, asthma, cystic fibrosis,\n                 pneumonia, and septic shock.",\n  journal     = "Am.

    Description: 'Proteomics data set for the human red blood cell.',
    Abstract:
      'In addition to transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide to and from the tissues, a range of other functions are attributed to red blood cells (RBCs) of vertebrates. Diseases compromising RBC performance in any of these functions warrant in-depth study. Furthermore, the human RBC is a vital host cell for the malaria parasite. Much has been learned from classical biochemical approaches about RBC composition and membrane organization. Here, we use mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics to characterize the normal RBC protein profile. The aim of this study was to obtain the most complete and informative human RBC proteome possible by combining high-accuracy, high-sensitivity protein identification technology (quadrupole time of flight and Fourier transform MS) with selected biochemical procedures for sample preparation. A total of 340 membrane proteins and 252 soluble proteins were identified, validated, and categorized in terms of subcellular localization, protein family, and function. Splice isoforms of proteins were identified, and polypeptides that migrated with anomalously high or low apparent molecular weights could be grouped into either ubiquitinylated, partially degraded, or ester-linked complexes. Our data reveal unexpected complexity of the RBC proteome, provide a wealth of data on its composition, shed light on several open issues in RBC biology, and form a departure point for comprehensive understanding of RBC functions.',

    Abstract:
      'Recent studies have underscored questions about the balance of risk and benefit of RBC transfusion. A better understanding of the nature and timing of molecular and functional changes in stored RBCs may provide strategies to improve the balance of benefit and risk of RBC transfusion. We analyzed changes occurring during RBC storage focusing on RBC deformability, RBC-dependent vasoregulatory function, and S-nitrosohemoglobin (SNO-Hb), through which hemoglobin (Hb) O(2) desaturation is coupled to regional increases in blood flow in vivo (hypoxic vasodilation). Five hundred ml of blood from each of 15 healthy volunteers was processed into leukofiltered, additive solution 3-exposed RBCs and stored at 1-6 degrees C according to AABB standards. Blood was subjected to 26 assays at 0, 3, 8, 24 and 96 h, and at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 weeks. RBC SNO-Hb decreased rapidly (1.2 x 10(-4) at 3 h vs. 6.5 x 10(-4) (fresh) mol S-nitrosothiol (SNO)/mol Hb tetramer (P = 0.032, mercuric-displaced photolysis-chemiluminescence assay), and remained low over the 42-day period. The decline was corroborated by using the carbon monoxide-saturated copper-cysteine assay [3.0 x 10(-5) at 3 h vs. 9.0 x 10(-5) (fresh) mol SNO/mol Hb]. In parallel, vasodilation by stored RBCs was significantly depressed. RBC deformability assayed at a physiological shear stress decreased gradually over the 42-day period (P < 0.001). Time courses vary for several storage-induced defects that might account for recent observations linking blood transfusion with adverse outcomes. Of clinical concern is that SNO levels, and their physiological correlate, RBC-dependent vasodilation, become depressed soon after collection, suggesting that even "fresh" blood may have developed adverse biological characteristics.',

      'An investigation of a hypoxia-mimetic effect, pulmonary vascular remodeling, that is associated with chronic systemic conversion of NAC to SNOAC in vivo.',
    Abstract:
      'NO transfer reactions between protein and peptide cysteines have been proposed to represent regulated signaling processes. We used the pharmaceutical antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) as a bait reactant to measure NO transfer reactions in blood and to study the vascular effects of these reactions in vivo. NAC was converted to S-nitroso-N-acetylcysteine (SNOAC), decreasing erythrocytic S-nitrosothiol content, both during whole-blood deoxygenation ex vivo and during a 3-week protocol in which mice received high-dose NAC in vivo. Strikingly, the NAC-treated mice developed pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that mimicked the effects of chronic hypoxia. Moreover, systemic SNOAC administration recapitulated effects of both NAC and hypoxia. eNOS-deficient mice were protected from the effects of NAC but not SNOAC, suggesting that conversion of NAC to SNOAC was necessary for the development of PAH. These data reveal an unanticipated adverse effect of chronic NAC administration and introduce a new animal model of PAH.

    Abstract:
      'The erythrocyte cytoplasmic proteome is composed of 98% hemoglobin; the remaining 2% is largely unexplored. Here we used a combinatorial library of hexameric peptides as a capturing agent to lower the signal of hemoglobin and amplify the signal of low to very low abundance proteins in the cytoplasm of human red blood cells (RBCs). Two types of hexapeptide library beads have been adopted: amino-terminal hexapeptide beads and beads in which the peptides have been further derivatized by carboxylation. The amplification of the signal of low abundance and suppression of the signal of high abundance species were fully demonstrated by two-dimensional gel maps and nano-LC-MSMS analysis. The effect of this new methodology on quantitative information also was explored. Moreover using this approach on an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer, we could identify with high confidence as many as 1578 proteins in the cytoplasmic fraction of a highly purified preparation of RBCs, allowing a deep exploration of the classical RBC pathways as well as the identification of unexpected minor proteins. In addition, we were able to detect the presence of eight different hemoglobin chains including embryonic and newly discovered globin chains. Thus, this extensive study provides a huge data set of proteins that are present in the RBC cytoplasm that may help to better understand the biology of this simplified cell and may open the way to further studies on blood pathologies using targeted approaches.',

    Abstract:
      "Automated collection of blood components offers multiple advantages and has prompted development of portable devices. This study sought to document the biochemical and hematologic properties and in vivo recovery of red cells (RBCs) collected via a new device that employed a variable-volume centrifugal separation chamber. Normal subjects (n = 153) donated 2 units of RBCs via an automated blood collection system (Cymbal, Haemonetics). Procedures were conducted with wall outlet power (n = 49) or the device's battery source (n = 104). Units were collected with or without leukoreduction filtration and were stored in AS-3 for 42 days. The units were assessed via standard biochemical and hematologic tests before and after storage, and 24 leukoreduced (LR) and 24 non-LR RBCs were radiolabeled on Day 42 with Na(2)(51)CrO(4) for autologous return to determine recovery at 24 hours with concomitant determination of RBC volume via infusion of (99m)Tc-labeled fresh RBCs. Two standard RBC units (targeted to contain 180 mL of RBCs plus 100 mL of AS-3) could be collected in 35.7 +/- 2.0 minutes (n = 30) or 40.3 +/- 2.7 minutes for LR RBCs (n = 92). An additional 31 collections were conducted successfully with intentional filter bypassing. RBC units contained 104 +/- 4.1 percent of their targeted volumes (170-204 mL of RBCs), and LR RBCs contained 92 percent of non-LR RBCs' hemoglobin. All LR RBCs contained less than 1 x 10(6) white blood cells. Mean hemolysis was below 0.8 percent (Day 42) for all configurations. Adenosine triphosphate was well preserved. Mean recovery was 82 +/- 4.9 percent for RBCs and 84 +/- 7.0 percent for LR RBCs. The Cymbal device provided quick and efficient collection of 2 RBC units with properties meeting regulatory requirements and consistent with good clinical utility.",

    Abstract:
      'The study of dynamic functions of large-scale biological networks has intensified in recent years. A critical component in developing an understanding of such dynamics involves the study of their hierarchical organization. We investigate the temporal hierarchy in biochemical reaction networks focusing on: (1) the elucidation of the existence of "pools" (i.e., aggregate variables) formed from component concentrations and (2) the determination of their composition and interactions over different time scales. To date the identification of such pools without prior knowledge of their composition has been a challenge. A new approach is developed for the algorithmic identification of pool formation using correlations between elements of the modal matrix that correspond to a pair of concentrations and how such correlations form over the hierarchy of time scales. The analysis elucidates a temporal hierarchy of events that range from chemical equilibration events to the formation of physiologically meaningful pools, culminating in a network-scale (dynamic) structure-(physiological) function relationship. This method is validated on a model of human red blood cell metabolism and further applied to kinetic models of yeast glycolysis and human folate metabolism, enabling the simplification of these models. The understanding of temporal hierarchy and the formation of dynamic aggregates on different time scales is foundational to the study of network dynamics and has relevance in multiple areas ranging from bacterial strain design and metabolic engineering to the understanding of disease processes in humans.',

      'An investigation of whether anaerobic storage with acidified additive solution coupled with metabolic rejuvenation might further improve the benefits of anaerobic storage.',
    Abstract:
      "Red cell (RBC) storage can be extended to 9 weeks under anaerobic or alkaline conditions. Simultaneous use of these approaches has not provided additive benefit. Our objective was to determine whether anaerobic storage with acidified additive solution (AS) coupled with metabolic rejuvenation might further improve the benefits of anaerobic storage. RBC storage in AS with a pH value of 6.5, 7.4, or 8.3 in aerobic or anaerobic conditions was examined using a panel of in vitro biochemical and RBC markers. RBC rejuvenation during cold storage was also evaluated. A randomized crossover radiolabeled recovery study (eight subjects) evaluated anaerobic RBC storage using AS65 with cold rejuvenation for up to 16 weeks of storage. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and diphosphoglycerate acid (DPG) were better maintained in anaerobic storage than in aerobic storage. Acidic or neutral AS preserved ATP concentration better, while a neutral or basic pH AS favored maintenance of DPG levels at higher levels for a longer period.

Simultaneous use of\n                 these approaches has not provided additive benefit. Our\n                 objective was to determine whether anaerobic storage with\n                 acidified additive solution (AS) coupled with metabolic\n                 rejuvenation might further improve the benefits of anaerobic\n                 storage. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: RBC storage in AS with a pH\n                 value of 6.5, 7.4, or 8.3 in aerobic or anaerobic conditions\n                 was examined using a panel of in vitro biochemical and RBC\n                 markers. RBC rejuvenation during cold storage was also\n                 evaluated. A randomized crossover radiolabeled recovery study\n                 (eight subjects) evaluated anaerobic RBC storage using AS65\n                 with cold rejuvenation for up to 16 weeks of storage. RESULTS:\n                 Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and diphosphoglycerate acid (DPG)\n                 were better maintained in anaerobic storage than in aerobic\n                 storage. Acidic or neutral AS preserved ATP concentration\n                 better, while a neutral or basic pH AS favored maintenance of\n                 DPG levels at higher levels for a longer period.

    Abstract:
      'FDA requirements for recovery of radiolabeled red blood cells (RBCs) 24 hours after autologous reinfusion in normal subjects have evolved over time. This study defined the ability of currently available RBC systems to satisfy the most recently proposed criteria. RBC recoveries were collected from US laboratories participating in clinical trials for RBC systems that have received FDA approval. Data were stratified for analysis into liquid-stored, gamma-irradiated, and frozen components. With statistical software, 24 individual samples were randomly selected with replacement from each stratum, repeating this for 5000 sample groups per stratum, to simulate experimental outcomes for each population. The percentage of sample groups that passed each and all of the proposed FDA criteria was determined. This procedure was repeated for recovery success thresholds of 75, 70, and 67 percent. A total of 941 RBC recoveries were obtained from 11 laboratories and 34 studies performed between 1990 and 2006 for 12 sponsors. While the criterion for the mean was almost always satisfied, the standard deviation (SD) criterion was more problematic. Causing most failures was the success threshold definition. Changing the success threshold from 75 to 70 percent or 67 percent increased the likelihood of meeting the requirement for all RBC types. The probability of passing the FDA-proposed criteria for currently FDA-approved products was poor. Changing the success threshold for an individual RBC recovery from 75 to 67 percent resulted in improved ability to meet this criterion for all three RBC types. This change had no affect on the pass rates based on the mean and SD criteria.',

    Description: 'An examination of the physiological constraints on red blood cell antioxidant defense.',
    Abstract:
      'The erythrocyte membrane is a newly appreciated platform for thiol-based circulatory signaling, and it requires robust free thiol maintenance. We sought to define physiological constraints on erythrocyte antioxidant defense. Hemoglobin (Hb) conformation gates glycolytic flux through the hexose monophosphate pathway (HMP), the sole source of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) in erythrocytes. We hypothesized elevated intraerythrocytic deoxyHb would limit resilience to oxidative stress. Human erythrocytes were subjected to controlled oxidant (superoxide) loading following independent manipulation of oxygen tension, Hb conformation, and glycolytic pathway dominance. Sufficiency of antioxidant defense was determined by serial quantification of GSH, NADPH, NADH redox couples. Hypoxic erythrocytes demonstrated greater loss of reduction potential [Delta GSH E(hc) (mV): 123.4+/-9.7 vs. 57.2+/-11.1] and reduced membrane thiol (47.7+/-5.7 vs. 20.1+/-4.3%) (hypoxia vs. normoxia, respectively; P<0.01), a finding mimicked in normoxic erythrocytes after HMP blockade. Rebalancing HMP flux during hypoxia restored resilience to oxidative stress at all stages of the system. Cell-free studies assured oxidative loading was not altered by oxygen tension, heme ligation, or the inhibitors employed. These data indicate that Hb conformation controls coupled glucose and thiol metabolism in erythrocytes, and implicate hypoxemia in the pathobiology of erythrocyte-based vascular signaling.',

    Description: 'An investigation of how genetic and environmental perturbations affect the metabolic network of the red blood cell.',
    Abstract:
      "A growing number of realistic in silico models of metabolic functions are being formulated and can serve as 'dry lab' platforms to prototype and simulate experiments before they are performed. For example, dual perturbation experiments that vary both genetic and environmental parameters can readily be simulated in silico. Genetic and environmental perturbations were applied to a cell-scale model of the human erythrocyte and subsequently investigated. The resulting steady state fluxes and concentrations, as well as dynamic responses to the perturbations were analyzed, yielding two important conclusions: 1) that transporters are informative about the internal states (fluxes and concentrations) of a cell and, 2) that genetic variations can disrupt the natural sequence of dynamic interactions between network components. The former arises from adjustments in energy and redox states, while the latter is a result of shifting time scales in aggregate pool formation of metabolites. These two concepts are illustrated for glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and pyruvate kinase (PK) in the human red blood cell. Dual perturbation experiments in silico are much more informative for the characterization of functional states than single perturbations. Predictions from an experimentally validated cellular model of metabolism indicate that the measurement of cofactor precursor transport rates can inform the internal state of the cell when the external demands are altered or a causal genetic variation is introduced. Finally, genetic mutations that alter the clinical phenotype may also disrupt the 'natural' time scale hierarchy of interactions in the network.",

    Abstract:
      'Blood samples used in hemorheological studies may be stored for a period of time, the effects of storage have yet to be fully explored. This study evaluated the effects of storage temperature (i.e., 4 degrees C or 25 degrees C) and duration on RBC deformability and aggregation for blood from healthy controls and from septic patients. Our results indicate that for normal blood, RBC deformability over 0.3-50 Pa is stable up to six hours regardless of storage temperature; at eight hours there were no significant differences in EI but SS1/2 calculated via a Lineweaver-Burk method indicated impaired deformability. Storage temperature affected the stable period for RBC aggregation: the safe time was shorter at 25 degrees C whereas at 4 degrees C aggregation was stable up to 12 hours. Interestingly, blood samples from septic patients were less affected by storage. Blood can thus be stored at 25 degrees C for up to six hours for deformability studies, but should be limited to four hours for RBC aggregation; storage at 4 degrees C may prolong the storage period up to 12 hours for aggregation but not deformability measurements. Therefore, the time period between sampling and measurement should be as short as possible and reported together with results.',

    Abstract:
      'In preliminary studies, anaerobic red blood cell (RBC) storage reduced oxidative damage and phosphatidylserine exposure while maintaining adenosine triphosphate levels. The purpose of this study was to compare the 24-hour recovery and life span of autologous RBCs stored 6 and 9 weeks using OFAS3 additive solution in an anaerobic environment, compared to control RBCs aerobically stored in AS-3 for 6 weeks. Eight subjects were entered into a randomized, crossover study. Whole blood was collected from each subject twice separated by 12 weeks or more into CP2D and leukoreduced. Controls were stored in AS-3. Test units in OFAS3 were oxygen depleted with argon then stored 9 weeks in an anaerobic chamber at 1 to 6 degrees C. At the end of each storage period, RBCs were labeled with (51)Cr and (99m)Tc and reinfused to the subject following standard methods to determine double-label recovery and life span. Hypotheses tests were conducted using paired, repeated-measures analysis of variance. Recovery for the anaerobically stored test RBC was significantly better than control at 6 weeks (p = 0.023). Test units at 9 weeks were not different than the 6-week control units (p = 0.73). Other in vitro measures of RBC characteristics followed the same trend. Two test units at 9 weeks had hemolysis of greater than 1 percent. Anaerobically stored RBCs in OFAS3 have superior recovery at 6 weeks compared to the controls and equivalent recovery at 9 weeks with no change in life span. Anaerobic storage of RBCs may provide improved RBCs for transfusion at 6 weeks of storage and may enable extending storage beyond the current 42-day limit.',

      'A brief forward that discusses the current state of transfusion medicine, how we evaluate blood quality, and where future directions might take the transfusion community.',
    Abstract:
      "Blood for transfusion must be safe, effective, available and cheap,\" the late John Collins said in a meeting of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine in 1973 during efforts to license the 5-week CPDA-1 blood storage solution1. These objectives seem clear individually, but it is usually in their interactions that controversy arises and hard decisions must be made. Most of us are familiar with the interactions of blood safety and the cost of new tests or of new restrictions on the donor population and the availability of components. We all struggle to find new voluntary donors with healthy lifestyles and to justify and pay for increasingly sensitive testing. However, the interactions between blood's effectiveness and its availability or its cost are less well known. In part this is because the whole concept of blood effectiveness is poorly defined. To the extent that red cell effectiveness has measurable meaning, red cells must be intact, circulate, and survive to be effective, so measures of their hemolysis, in vivo recovery, and survival have been gold standards for decades. Other measures, such as the red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) concentration or their nitric oxide content, have less clear physiologic significance and corresponding lower regulatory importance.",

    Abstract:
      'To assess progress toward ensuring a globally safe blood supply. We examined 2 global databases for blood safety: (1) that of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS (UNGASS) blood safety indicator; and (2) that of the Global Database on Blood Safety (GDBS), a database developed by the World Health Organization. The UNGASS data were collected through the Ministry of Health based on the GDBS data, followed by a reconciliation and cross-checking of the data by World Health Organization and United Nations Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS). The proportion of United Nations member countries reporting UNGASS data for blood safety is among the highest of all UNGASS indicators: 147 of 192 United Nations Member States participated in UNGASS reporting in 2008 and 125 of them (85%) submitted data on blood safety. Ninety-one of the 125 countries (73%) reported that 100% of collected blood units were screened in a quality assured manner, but 34 countries did not screen all collected blood units in accordance with minimum quality standards. GDBS data showed that 80.7 million blood units were collected globally in 167 countries during 2004-2005, of which 77.3 million were tested for HIV and at least 0.6 million of the remaining 3.4 million donations went untested. Progress has been made toward eliminating blood transfusion as a significant cause of HIV infection globally. Screening all donated blood for HIV in accordance with minimum quality standards remains vital, however, as health care systems should, at a minimum, do no harm. This goal is achievable and would assist in reaching Millennium Development Goals by 2015.',

    Abstract:
      'Following the publication of recent retrospective and highly debated studies, transfusionists are increasingly asking for improved tools to assess the quality of transfusion-relevant products. At its dawn, proteomics emerged as a potential candidate for in-depth investigations of blood components and plasma derivatives.

Proteomic strategies have been demonstrated to be also suited to verify the effects of the production and pathogen-reduction processes of plasma derivatives and blood components on the protein fractions, or to discover particular biomarkers readily adoptable for targeted evaluation of blood-component integrity or functionality.

    Abstract:
      'The ability to characterize biological dynamics is important for understanding the integrated molecular processes that underlie normal and abnormal cellular states. The availability of metabolomic data, in addition to new developments in the formal description of dynamic states of networks, has enabled a new data integration approach for building large-scale kinetic networks. We show that dynamic network models can be constructed in a scalable manner using metabolomic data mapped onto stoichiometric models, resulting in mass action stoichiometric simulation (MASS) models. Enzymes and their various functional states are represented explicitly as compounds, or nodes in a stoichiometric network, within this formalism. Analyses and simulations of MASS models explicitly show that regulatory enzymes can control dynamic states of networks in part by binding numerous metabolites at multiple sites. Thus, network functional states are reflected in the fractional states of a regulatory enzyme, such as the fraction of the total enzyme concentration that is in a catalytically active versus inactive state. The feasible construction of MASS models represents a practical means to increase the size, scope, and predictive capabilities of dynamic network models in cell and molecular biology.',

      "The focus of the present study was to define the human plasma lipidome and to establish novel analytical methodologies to quantify the large spectrum of plasma lipids. Partial lipid analysis is now a regular part of every patient's blood test and physicians readily and regularly prescribe drugs that alter the levels of major plasma lipids such as cholesterol and triglycerides. Plasma contains many thousands of distinct lipid molecular species that fall into six main categories including fatty acyls, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, sterols, and prenols. The physiological contributions of these diverse lipids and how their levels change in response to therapy remain largely unknown. As a first step toward answering these questions, we provide herein an in-depth lipidomics analysis of a pooled human plasma obtained from healthy individuals after overnight fasting and with a gender balance and an ethnic distribution that is representative of the US population. In total, we quantitatively assessed the levels of over 500 distinct molecular species distributed among the main lipid categories. As more information is obtained regarding the roles of individual lipids in health and disease, it seems likely that future blood tests will include an ever increasing number of these lipid molecules.",

      'Red blood cells are still the most widely transfused blood component worldwide and their story is intimately entwined with the history of transfusion medicine and the changes in the collection and storage of blood. At present, the most widely used protocol for the storage of red blood cells (for up to 42 days) is the collection of blood into anticoagulant solutions (typically citrate-dextrose-phosphate); red cell concentrates are prepared by the removal of plasma and, in some cases, also leukoreduction. The product is stored at 4 \u00b1 2\u00b0 C in a slightly hypertonic additive solution, generally SAGM (sodium, adenine, glucose, mannitol, 376 mOsm/L).',

    Description: 'An in-depth investigation of the pH regulation within red blood cells.',
    Abstract:
      "Our understanding of pH regulation within red blood cells (RBCs) has been inferred mainly from indirect experiments rather than from in situ measurements of intracellular pH (pH(i)). The present work shows that carboxy-SNARF-1, a pH fluorophore, when used with confocal imaging or flow cytometry, reliably reports pH(i) in individual, human RBCs, provided intracellular fluorescence is calibrated using a 'null-point' procedure. Mean pH(i) was 7.25 in CO(2)/HCO(3)(-)-buffered medium and 7.15 in Hepes-buffered medium, and varied linearly with extracellular pH (slope of 0.77). Intrinsic (non-CO(2)/HCO(3)(-)-dependent) buffering power, estimated in the intact cell (85 mmol (l cell)(-1) (pH unit)(-1) at resting pH(i)), was somewhat higher than previous estimates from cell lysates (50-70 mmol (l cell)(-1) (pH unit)(-1)). Acute displacement of pH(i) (superfusion of weak acids/bases) triggered rapid pH(i) recovery. This was mediated via membrane Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange (the AE1 gene product), irrespective of whether recovery was from an intracellular acid or base load, and with no evident contribution from other transporters such as Na(+)/H(+) exchange. H(+)-equivalent flux through AE1 was a linear function of [H(+)](i) and reversed at resting pH(i), indicating that its activity is not allosterically regulated by pH(i), in contrast to other AE isoforms. By simultaneously monitoring pH(i) and markers of cell volume, a functional link between membrane ion transport, volume and pH(i) was demonstrated. RBC pH(i) is therefore tightly regulated via AE1 activity, but modulated during changes of cell volume. A comparable volume-pH(i) link may also be important in other cell types expressing anion exchangers. Direct measurement of pH(i) should be useful in future investigations of RBC physiology and pathology.",

By simultaneously monitoring pH(i) and markers of\n                 cell volume, a functional link between membrane ion transport,\n                 volume and pH(i) was demonstrated. RBC pH(i) is therefore\n                 tightly regulated via AE1 activity, but modulated during\n                 changes of cell volume. A comparable volume-pH(i) link may\n                 also be important in other cell types expressing anion\n                 exchangers. Direct measurement of pH(i) should be useful in\n                 future investigations of RBC physiology and pathology.",\n  journal     = "J.

    Abstract:
      'Blood banking is a medical logistic activity. It attempts to bring the potentially life-saving benefits of transfusion to the patients who need them by making blood components available, safe, effective and cheap. Blood banks try to maximize delivering getting blood from the right donors to the right patients in a timely manner. The easiest way to assure the timely availability of blood is to have an appropriate inventory on the shelf at all times. Standards for blood banking have evolved in response to problems observed in the past. Donors need to be free of syphilis, hepatitis, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and from a host of other diseases as well. Methods for cleaning the arms of donors should work. Blood bags should contain the appropriate solutions and be sterile. Systems for the identification of donors and patients, for the determination of antigens on their blood cells and the antibodies in their sera, and for the procedures and processes used to gather and maintain this information should be robust.',

      'Although a preliminary portrait of the red blood cell proteome and interactome has already been provided, the recent identification of 1578 gene products from the erythrocyte cytosol asks for an updated and improved view. In this paper, we exploit data available from recent literature to compile a nonredundant list of 1989 proteins and elaborate it with pathway and network analyses. Upon network analysis, it is intuitively confirmed that red blood cells likely suffer of exacerbated oxidative stress and continuously strive against protein and cytoskeletal damage. It also emerges that erythrocyte interaction networks display a high degree of maturity. Indeed, a series of core proteins were individuated to play a central role. A catalytic ring of proteins counteracting oxidative stress was individuated as well. In parallel, pathway analysis confirmed the validity of observations about the SEC23B gene role in CDA II in a fast and unbiased way.',

    Abstract:
      'Transfusion-transmitted infections and immunologic effects of viable residual lymphocytes remain a concern in red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. Pathogen reduction technologies for RBC components are under development to further improve transfusion safety. S-303 is a frangible anchor-linker-effector with labile alkylating activity and a robust pathogen reduction profile. This study characterized the viability of RBCs prepared with a second-generation S-303 process and stored for 35 days. This was a two-center, single-blind randomized, controlled, crossover study in 27 healthy subjects. S-303 (test) or control RBCs were prepared in random sequence and stored for 35 days, at which time an aliquot of radiolabeled RBCs was transfused. The 24-hour recovery, RBC life span, and in vitro metabolic and viability variables were analyzed. The mean 24-hour RBC recovery and hemolysis of test RBCs were similar to control RBCs and were consistent with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance for RBC viability. The mean differences in life span and median life span (T(50) ) of circulating test RBCs were 13.7 and 6.8 days, while the mean difference in the area under the curve of surviving RBCs was 1.38%, in favor of control RBCs. There were no clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values after the infusion of test RBCs. All crossmatch assays of autologous S-303 RBCs were nonreactive. RBCs prepared using the S-303 pathogen inactivation process were physiologically and metabolically suitable for transfusion after 35 days of storage, met the FDA guidance criteria for 24-hour recovery, and did not induce antibody formation.',

    Description:
      'This study was done to assess the response capability of RBCs from 30 to 120 days of storage in three FDA-licensed RBC storage solutions after incubation with a rejuvenating solution of pyruvate, inosine, phosphate, and adenine.',
    Abstract:
      'Red blood cells (RBCs) are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for 42-day storage with the use of additive solutions (ASs). However, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) levels in the RBCs decline over this time. These constituents may be restored by treatment with rejuvenation (REJ) solutions. This study was done to assess the response capability of RBCs from 30 to 120 days of storage in three FDA-licensed RBC storage solutions after incubation with a rejuvenating solution of pyruvate, inosine, phosphate, and adenine. Three units each of RBCs in approved AS (AS-1 [Adsol, Fenwal, Inc.], AS-3 [Nutricel, Medsep Corp.], and AS-5 [Optisol, Terumo Corp.]) were stored under standard conditions at 1 to 6\u00b0C for up to 120 days. Aliquots (4 mL) on Days 30, 42, 60, 80, 100, and 120 (\u00b1 2 days) were REJ by incubating with Rejuvesol (Encyte Corp.). Control untreated and REJ aliquots were extracted using perchloric acid and stored at -80\u00b0C until assayed for 2,3-DPG and ATP. RBCs responded to REJ by increasing DPG and ATP contents. The response declined linearly at 0.070 \u00b1 0.008 \u00b5mol DPG/g hemoglobin (Hb)/day and 0.035 \u00b1 0.004 \u00b5mol ATP/g Hb/day with no differences between ASs. We conclude that Rejuvesol is able to restore ATP and 2,3-DPG levels in RBCs stored up to 120 days in AS. The response diminishes as storage time increases. This rejuvenation (REJ) capability does not seem useful for routine assessment of RBC anabolic capacity in research programs, but may be useful to the investigator when studying unique and novel treatment methods.',

This study was\n                 done to assess the response capability of RBCs from 30 to 120\n                 days of storage in three FDA-licensed RBC storage solutions\n                 after incubation with a rejuvenating solution of pyruvate,\n                 inosine, phosphate, and adenine. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:\n                 Three units each of RBCs in approved AS (AS-1 [Adsol, Fenwal,\n                 Inc.], AS-3 [Nutricel, Medsep Corp.], and AS-5 [Optisol,\n                 Terumo Corp.]) were stored under standard conditions at 1 to\n                 6\u00b0C for up to 120 days. Aliquots (4 mL) on Days 30, 42, 60,\n                 80, 100, and 120 ($\\pm$ 2 days) were REJ by incubating with\n                 Rejuvesol (Encyte Corp.). Control untreated and REJ aliquots\n                 were extracted using perchloric acid and stored at -80\u00b0C until\n                 assayed for 2,3-DPG and ATP. RESULTS: RBCs responded to REJ by\n                 increasing DPG and ATP contents. The response declined\n                 linearly at 0.070 $\\pm$ 0.008 \u00b5mol DPG/g hemoglobin (Hb)/day\n                 and 0.035 $\\pm$ 0.004 \u00b5mol ATP/g Hb/day with no differences\n                 between ASs. CONCLUSION: We conclude that Rejuvesol is able to\n                 restore ATP and 2,3-DPG levels in RBCs stored up to 120 days\n                 in AS. The response diminishes as storage time increases. This\n                 rejuvenation (REJ) capability does not seem useful for routine\n                 assessment of RBC anabolic capacity in research programs, but\n                 may be useful to the investigator when studying unique and\n                 novel treatment methods.",\n  journal     = "Transfusion",\n  volume      =  51,\n  number      =  7,\n  pages       = "1574--1579",\n  month       =  jul,\n  year        =  2011,\n  language    = "en"\n}\n',

      'An extensive review of the elements comprising a regulated, O2-responsive NO transport system in blood based on controlled NO processing within red blood cells.',
    Abstract:
      'The trapping, processing, and delivery of nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity by red blood cells (RBCs) have emerged as a conserved mechanism through which regional blood flow is linked to biochemical cues of perfusion sufficiency. We present here an expanded paradigm for the human respiratory cycle based on the coordinated transport of three gases: NO, O\u2082, and CO\u2082. By linking O\u2082 and NO flux, RBCs couple vessel caliber (and thus blood flow) to O\u2082 availability in the lung and to O\u2082 need in the periphery. The elements required for regulated O\u2082-based signal transduction via controlled NO processing within RBCs are presented herein, including S-nitrosothiol (SNO) synthesis by hemoglobin and O\u2082-regulated delivery of NO bioactivity (capture, activation, and delivery of NO groups at sites remote from NO synthesis by NO synthase). The role of NO transport in the respiratory cycle at molecular, microcirculatory, and system levels is reviewed. We elucidate the mechanism through which regulated NO transport in blood supports O\u2082 homeostasis, not only through adaptive regulation of regional systemic blood flow but also by optimizing ventilation-perfusion matching in the lung. Furthermore, we discuss the role of NO transport in the central control of breathing and in baroreceptor control of blood pressure, which subserve O\u2082 supply to tissue. Additionally, malfunctions of this transport and signaling system that are implicated in a wide array of human pathophysiologies are described. Understanding the (dys)function of NO processing in blood is a prerequisite for the development of novel therapies that target the vasoactive capacities of RBCs.',

      'A commentary that addresses some of the challenges for transfusion medicine experts and the physicians who care for the critically ill.',
    Abstract:
      'When oxygen delivery fails to support aerobic metabolism, a complex state of physiologic dissonance emerges, broadly designated as shock. As the oxygen debt in shock mounts, cascading organ failure will lead to death unless physiologic control is restored. Two principal blood functions are impaired in this setting: oxygen transport by red blood cells (RBCs) and the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis. This deteriorating state is compounded by the additional dysregulation of immune and endothelial function in critically ill patients who have minimal physiologic reserve to compensate for these changes. Paradoxically, mounting evidence suggests that blood component therapies (to correct anemia or coagulopathy) may exacerbate, rather than resolve, this condition\u2014possibly due to unintended consequences of blood product processing and storage. This may be particularly true for those with shock and coagulopathy since exacerbation of either condition will adversely affect the other.2,3 For critically ill patients with marginally compensated organ failure or those with shock and coagulopathy, it is essential that resuscitation is composed with such issues in mind. These high-risk patients may benefit from blood products of decreased storage duration that have increased function immediately upon transfusion as well as an improved safety profile.',

    Abstract:
      'Banked red blood cells (RBCs) undergo changes that reduce their viability after transfusion. Dysfunction of the glutathione (GSH) antioxidant system may be implicated. We measured the rate of GSH synthesis in stored RBCs and applied a model of GSH metabolism to identify storage-dependent changes that may affect GSH production. RBC units (n = 6) in saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol (SAGM) solution were each divided into four transfusion bags and separate treatments were applied: 1) SAGM (control), 2) GSH precursor amino acids, 3) aminoguanidine, and 4) glyoxal. RBCs were sampled during 6 weeks of storage. Rejuvenated RBCs were also analyzed. After 6 weeks, the ATP concentration declined to 50 \u00b1 5.5% (p < 0.05) of that in the fresh RBCs. For control RBCs, the GSH concentration decreased by 27 \u00b1 6.5% (p < 0.05) and the rate of GSH synthesis by 45 \u00b1 8% (p < 0.05). The rate of GSH synthesis in rejuvenated and amino acid-treated RBCs was unchanged after 6 weeks. Modeling identified that the decline in GSH synthesis was due to decreased intracellular substrate concentrations and reduced amino acid transport, secondary to decreased ATP concentration. This study has uniquely shown that the glutathione synthesis rate decreased significantly after 6 weeks in stored RBCs. Our results have identified potential opportunities for improvement of banked blood storage.',

    Abstract:
      'Hemagglutination is widely used in transfusion medicine and depends on several factors including antigens, antibodies, electrical properties of red blood cells and the environment of the reaction. Intermolecular forces are involved in agglutination with cell clumping occurring when the aggregation force is greater than the force of repulsion. Repulsive force is generated by negative charges on the red blood cell surface that occur due to the presence of the carboxyl group of sialic acids in the cell membrane; these charges create a repulsive electric zeta potential between cells. In transfusion services, specific solutions are used to improve hemagglutination, including enzymes that reduce the negative charge of red blood cells, LISS which improves the binding of antibodies to antigens and macromolecules that decrease the distance between erythrocytes. The specificity and sensitivity of immunohematological reactions depend directly on the appropriate use of these solutions. Knowledge of the electrical properties of red blood cells and of the action of enhancement solutions can contribute to the immunohematology practice in transfusion services.',

      'Cell-scale metabolic model of the human red blood cell, informed through manual curation of the literature and built using proteomics data.',
    Abstract:
      "The development of high-throughput technologies capable of whole cell measurements of genes, proteins, and metabolites has led to the emergence of systems biology. Integrated analysis of the resulting omic data sets has proved to be hard to achieve. Metabolic network reconstructions enable complex relationships amongst molecular components to be represented formally in a biologically relevant manner while respecting physical constraints. In silico models derived from such reconstructions can then be queried or interrogated through mathematical simulations. Proteomic profiling studies of the mature human erythrocyte have shown more proteins present related to metabolic function than previously thought; however the significance and the causal consequences of these findings have not been explored. Erythrocyte proteomic data was used to reconstruct the most expansive description of erythrocyte metabolism to date, following extensive manual curation, assessment of the literature, and functional testing. The reconstruction contains 281 enzymes representing functions from glycolysis to cofactor and amino acid metabolism. Such a comprehensive view of erythrocyte metabolism implicates the erythrocyte as a potential biomarker for different diseases as well as a 'cell-based' drug-screening tool. The analysis shows that 94 erythrocyte enzymes are implicated in morbid single nucleotide polymorphisms, representing 142 pathologies.

      'Preliminary results about testing of the hypothesis whether the anomalous and irreversible changes in protein patterns (in particular Prdx2), which we could outline in our previous investigations on blood storage.',
    Abstract:
      'Blood doping represents one main trend in doping strategies. Blood doping refers to the practice of boosting the number of red blood cells (RBCs) in the bloodstream in order to enhance athletic performance, by means of blood transfusions, administration of erythropoiesis-stimulating substances, blood substitutes, natural or artificial altitude facilities, and innovative gene therapies. While detection of recombinant EPO and homologous transfusion is already feasible through electrophoretic, mass spectrometry or flow cytometry-based approaches, no method is currently available to tackle doping strategies relying on autologous transfusions. We exploited an in vitro model of autologous transfusion through a 1:10 dilution of concentrated RBCs after 30 days of storage upon appropriate dilution in freshly withdrawn RBCs from the same donor. Western blot towards membrane Prdx2 and Percoll density gradients were exploited to assess their suitability as biomarkers of transfusion. Mmbrane Prdx2 was visible in day 30 samples albeit not in day 0, while it was still visible in the 1:10 dilution of day 30 in day 0 RBCs. Cell gradients also highlighted changes in the profile of the RBC subpopulations upon dilution of stored RBCs in the fresh ones. From this preliminary in vitro investigation it emerges that Prdx2 and RBC populations might be further tested as candidate biomarkers of blood doping through autologous transfusion, though it is yet to be assessed whether the kinetics in vivo of Prdx2 exposure in the membrane of transfused RBCs will endow a sufficient time-window to allow reliable anti-doping testing.',

      'Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is indicated to improve oxygen delivery to tissue, and for no other purpose. We have come to appreciate that donor RBCs are fundamentally altered during processing and storage in a manner that both impairs oxygen transport efficacy and introduces additional risk by perturbing both immune and coagulation systems. The protean biophysical and physiological changes in RBC function arising from storage are termed the "storage lesion;" many have been understood for some time; for example, we know that the oxygen affinity of stored blood rises during the storage period and that intracellular allosteric regulators, notably 2,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid and ATP, are depleted during storage. Our appreciation of other storage lesion features has emerged with improved understanding of coagulation, immune, and vascular signaling systems. Here, we review key features of the "storage lesion." Additionally, we call particular attention to the newly appreciated role of RBCs in regulating linkage between regional blood flow and regional O(2) consumption by regulating the bioavailability of key vasoactive mediators in plasma, and discuss how processing and storage disturb this key signaling function and impair transfusion efficacy.',

    Description: 'An examination of red blood cells during cell processing for preparation to cryostorage.',
    Abstract:
      'Cryostorage of red blood cells (RBCs) represents a valid alternative to liquid storage, since units can be preserved safely for at least a decade while conserving RBC viability. While cryostorage has attracted a great deal of attention clinically, little is known about the biochemistry and physiology of cryostored erythrocyte concentrates. In the present study, we investigated cryostorage of RBCs through monitoring of cell processing steps (from fresh blood, to glycerolization, thawing and deglycerolization/washing) through repeated assays of standard parameters (MCV, RDW-SD) and scanning electron microscopy. Cell processing for cryostorage resulted in increased RBC volumes. Shape alterations caused an increase in osmotic fragility and permeability to ions. A significant pH drop was observed which could not to be attributed to a higher metabolic rate, since the levels of lactate did not show substantial fluctuation during the cell processing steps tested in this study. Membrane anomalies are likely related to the hemolysis observed which preferentially affected the densest and oldest cell sub-populations, as confirmed by means of discontinuous density gradients. Our results indicate that cryostorage itself in presence of glycerol does not significantly affect RBCs. Most of the alterations observed were related to cell processing and, in particular, to the increase of cytosolic glycerol as a consequence of the glycerolyzation step. Further studies might profitably investigate replacing glycerol with non-penetrating cryoprotectants.',

    Description: 'A combined metabolomics and proteomics investigation of the biochemistry of stored red blood cells.',
    Abstract:
      'Results from recent, highly debated, retrospective studies raised concerns and prompted considerations about further testing the quality of long stored red blood cells from a biochemical standpoint. We performed an integrated mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and proteomics time-course investigation on SAGM-stored red blood cells. In parallel, structural changes during storage were monitored through scanning electron microscopy. We detected increased levels of glycolytic metabolites over the first 2 weeks of storage. From day 14 onwards, we observed a significant consumption of all metabolic species, and diversion towards the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway. These phenomena coincided with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and markers of oxidation (protein carbonylation and malondialdehyde accumulation) up to day 28. Proteomics evidenced changes at the membrane protein level from day 14 onwards. Changes included fragmentation of membrane structural proteins (spectrin, band 3, band 4.1), membrane accumulation of hemoglobin, anti-oxidant enzymes (peroxiredoxin-2) and chaperones. While the integrity of red blood cells did not show major deviations at day 14, at day 21 scanning electron microscope images revealed that 50% of the erythrocytes had severely altered shape. We could correlate the scanning electron microscopy observations with the onset of vesiculation, through a proteomics snapshot of the difference in the membrane proteome at day 0 and day 35. We detected proteins involved in vesicle formation and docking to the membrane, such as SNAP alpha. Biochemical and structural parameters did not show significant alterations in the first 2 weeks of storage, but then declined constantly from day 14 onwards. We highlighted several parallelisms between red blood cells stored for a long time and the red blood cells of patients with hereditary spherocytosis.',

      'An evaluation of a candidate replacement plasticizer (Hexamoll, di-isononyl cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid [DINCH], BASF Corp.) compared to DEHP in an in vitro feasibility study.',
    Abstract:
      'The plasticizer di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) is a common component in medical plastics. There is motivation to replace this component; however, DEHP is necessary to prevent excessive hemolysis in stored red blood cells (RBCs). Our objective is to evaluate a candidate replacement plasticizer (Hexamoll, di-isononyl cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid [DINCH], BASF Corp.) compared to DEHP in an in vitro feasibility study. We hypothesize that the candidate will provide at least equivalent protection against hemolysis for RBCs stored for 42 days and periodic mixing of RBCs will add additional protection against hemolysis. Whole blood was collected into citrate-phosphate-dextrose; combined into pools of 2 ABO identical whole blood units; and divided, leukoreduced, centrifuged, and separated into plasma and RBCs. Additive solution was added, and the RBCs were stored for 42 days at 1 to 6\u00b0C. In three parts of this study, split pools were paired as DINCH-polyvinyl chloride (PVC) with weekly mixing versus DINCH-PVC with no mixing, DINCH-PVC mixed versus DEHP-PVC no mix, and DINCH-PVC versus DEHP-PVC with neither mixed. A standard panel of in vitro RBC characteristics was determined on Days 0 and 42. Mixing DINCH-PVC weekly improved Day 42 hemolysis (0.36 \u00b1 0.07% vs.0.56 \u00b1 0.15%, p = 0.002), and mixed DINCH-PVC bags were noninferior to unmixed DEHP-PVC bags (p \u2264 0.05). DINCH-PVC bags stored without weekly mixing were inferior to unmixed DEHP-PVC bags for hemolysis on Day 42, although no individual bag exceeded 0.8% hemolysis. Periodic mixing of RBCs stored in DINCH-PVC provides additional protection against hemolysis. Unmixed DINCH-PVC bags were inferior to DEHP-PVC bags for prevention of hemolysis, but remain a candidate for replacement DEHP in RBC storage bags.',

    Description:
      'An examination of whether the membrane protein profiles of RBCs stored in CP2D-AS-3 followed a trend that could be compared to the one we have already reported for CPD-SAGM counterparts.',
    Abstract:
      'SAGM is currently the standard additive solution used in Europe, while AS-3 is the third additive solution that has been licensed in the USA, and is also the one used in part of Canada. Although AS-3 is based on a saline-adenine-glucose solution, it also contains citrate and phosphate. Storage of red blood cell concentrates in CPD-SAGM is known to lead to the accumulation of a wide series of storage lesions, including membrane protein fragmentation and vesiculation, as we could previously determine through 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Through 2D-SDS-IEF-polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis we performed a time course analysis (day 0, 21 and 42 of storage) of red blood cell membranes from leukocyte-filtered concentrates either stored in CPD-SAGM or CP2D-AS-3. From the present study it emerges that the membrane protein profile of red blood cells stored in presence of AS-3 appears to be slightly different from (better than) previous reports on SAGM-stored counterparts. However, the increase of total membrane spot number due to the presence of fragments at day 21 and the significant decrease at day 42 are suggestive of a universal phenomenon which is not efficiently tackled by either of the two additive solutions investigated in the present study. To further delve into the storage lesion issue for RBCs stored in AS-3, it would be interesting in the future to assay metabolic changes over storage progression as well.',

However, the\n                 increase of total membrane spot number due to the presence of\n                 fragments at day 21 and the significant decrease at day 42 are\n                 suggestive of a universal phenomenon which is not efficiently\n                 tackled by either of the two additive solutions investigated\n                 in the present study. CONCLUSION: To further delve into the\n                 storage lesion issue for RBCs stored in AS-3, it would be\n                 interesting in the future to assay metabolic changes over\n                 storage progression as well.",\n  journal     = "Blood Transfus.",\n  volume      = "10 Suppl 2",\n  pages       = "s46--54",\n  month       =  may,\n  year        =  2012,\n  language    = "en"\n}\n',

    Abstract:
      'Erythrocyte concentrates for transfusion purposes represent a life-saving therapeutics of primary relevance in the clinical setting. However, efforts have been continuously proposed to improve safety and efficacy of long-term stored red blood cells. By means of liquid chromatography coupled with Q-TOF mass spectrometry, we were able to perform an untargeted metabolomics analysis in order to highlight metabolic species (i.e. low molecular biochemicals including sugars, lipids, nucleotides, aminoacids, etc.), both in red blood cells and supernatants, which showed fluctuations against day 0 controls over storage duration on a weekly basis. We could confirm and expand existing literature about the rapid fall of glycolytic rate and accumulation of glycolysis end products. A shift was observed towards the oxidative phase of pentose phosphate pathway, in response to an exacerbation of oxidative stress (altered glutathione homeostasis and accumulation of peroxidation/inflammatory products in the supernatant). The present study provides the first evidence that over storage duration metabolic fluxes in red blood cells proceed from pentose phosphate pathway towards purine salvage pathway, instead of massively re-entering glycolysis via the nonoxidative phase.

      'An investigation of erythrocyte cell membrane deformability in patients before and after transfusion to determine the effects of storage duration and whether changes in deformability are reversible after transfusion.',
    Abstract:
      'Erythrocyte cell membranes undergo morphologic changes during storage, but it is unclear whether these changes are reversible. We assessed erythrocyte cell membrane deformability in patients before and after transfusion to determine the effects of storage duration and whether changes in deformability are reversible after transfusion. Sixteen patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion surgery were studied. Erythrocyte deformability was compared between those who required moderate transfusion (\u2265 5 units erythrocytes) and those who received minimal transfusion (0-4 units erythrocytes). Deformability was measured in samples drawn directly from the blood storage bags before transfusion and in samples drawn from patients before and after transfusion (over 3 postoperative days). In samples taken from the blood storage bags, we compared deformability of erythrocytes stored for a long duration (\u2265 21 days), those stored for a shorter duration (<21 days), and cell-salvaged erythrocytes. Deformability was assessed quantitatively using the elongation index (EI) measured by ektacytometry, a method that determines the ability for the cell to elongate when exposed to shear stress. Erythrocyte deformability was significantly decreased from the preoperative baseline in patients after moderate transfusion (EI decreased by 12% \u00b1 4% to 20% \u00b1 6%; P = 0.03) but not after minimal transfusion (EI decreased by 3% \u00b1 1% to 4% \u00b1 1%; P = 0.68). These changes did not reverse over 3 postoperative days. Deformability was significantly less in erythrocytes stored for \u2265 21 days (EI = 0.28 \u00b1 0.02) than in those stored for <21 days (EI = 0.33 \u00b1 0.02; P = 0.001) or those drawn from patients preoperatively (EI = 0.33 \u00b1 0.02; P = 0.001). Cell-salvaged erythrocytes had intermediate deformability (EI = 0.30 \u00b1 0.03) that was greater than that of erythrocytes stored \u2265 21 days (P = 0.047), but less than that of erythrocytes stored <21 days (P = 0.03). The findings demonstrate that increased duration of erythrocyte storage is associated with decreased cell membrane deformability and that these changes are not readily reversible after transfusion.',

      'Despite decades of advancements, the investigation of the red blood cell (RBC) cytosolic proteome still represents a challenging task because of the overwhelming abundance of hemoglobin. Besides, the separation method is one of the main limiting factors when investigating protein complexes. In this study, we performed for the first time a 2D-clear native (CN)-SDS-PAGE followed by mass spectrometry-based identification to screen multiprotein complexes (MCPs) in the cytosol of human RBCs. Upstream to 2D-CN-SDS-PAGE, we applied a recently developed native pre-enrichment strategy that allows discriminating and separately collecting three distinct fractions, one of which is highly enriched for hemoglobin. Such prefractionation strategy is conservative, in that it makes soluble native-complex analyses amenable without loss of biological information. Because of the resolution of native gel electrophoresis techniques, we could observe and describe 55 potential hetero-oligomeric MPCs from the RBC native cytosolic proteome, among which ultratetrameric hemoglobin. The detected protein complexes were characterized by proteins mainly involved in oxygen transport, antioxidant responses, metabolism, and protein degradation cascades, in agreement with recent in silico models. Metabolic enzyme oligomers also interacted with complexes of proteins involved in oxidative stress responses, thus suggesting a functional relationship between metabolic modulation and antioxidant defenses.',

    Description: 'An integrated flow cytometry and proteomic and metabolomic analysis of five distinct red blood cell subpopulations.',
    Abstract:
      'It has long been known that red blood cells comprise various subpopulations, which can be separated through Percoll density gradients. In this study, we performed integrated flow cytometry, proteomic and metabolomic analyses on five distinct red blood cell subpopulations obtained by Percoll density gradient separation of freshly drawn leucocyte-depleted erythrocyte concentrates. The relation of density gradient fractions to cell age was confirmed through band 4.1a/4.1b assays. We observed a decrease in size and increase in cell rugosity in older (denser) populations. Metabolomic analysis of fraction 5 (the oldest population) showed a decrease of glycolytic metabolism and of anti-oxidant defence-related mechanisms, resulting in decreased activation of the pentose phosphate pathway, less accumulation of NADPH and reduced glutathione and increased levels of oxidized glutathione. These observations strengthen conclusions about the role of oxidative stress in erythrocyte ageing in vivo, in analogy with results of recent in vitro studies. On the other hand, no substantial proteomic differences were observed among fractions. This result was partly explained by intrinsic technical limitations of the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis approach and the probable clearance from the bloodstream of erythrocytes with membrane protein alterations. Since this clearance effect is not present in vitro (in blood bank conditions), proteomic studies have shown substantial membrane lesions in ageing red blood cells in vitro. This analysis shows that the three main red blood cell subpopulations, accounting for over 92% of the total RBC, are rather homogeneous soon after withdrawal. Major age-related alterations in vivo probably affect enzyme activities through post-translational mechanisms rather than through changes in the overall proteomic profile of RBC.',

However, the recent introduction of novel mass spectrometry-based approaches lends itself to implement our understanding of the effects of red blood cell prolonged exposure to anaerobiosis. Indeed, most of the studies conducted so far have addressed the short term issue, while the limited body of literature covering a 42 days storage period only takes into account a handful of metabolic parameters (ATP, DPG, glucose, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and lactate). We hereby performed a mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics analysis in order to highlight metabolic species in erythrocyte concentrates stored anaerobically in SAGM additive solutions for up to 42 days, by testing cells on a weekly basis. We could confirm previous evidence about long term anaerobiosis promoting glycolytic metabolism in RBCs and prolonging the conservation of high energy phosphate reservoirs and purine homeostasis. In parallel, we evidenced that, in contrast to aerobic storage, anaerobiosis impairs erythrocyte capacity to cope with oxidative stress by blocking metabolic diversion towards the pentose phosphate pathway, which negatively affects glutathione homeostasis. Therefore, although oxidative stress was less sustained than in aerobically stored counterparts, oxidative stress markers still accumulate over anaerobic storage progression.',

      'An illustration of abnormal (O2-dependent) association of sickle hemoglobin to red blood cell membranes that interferes with sequestration/inactivation of the EMP enzyme GAPDH.',
    Abstract:
      'Energy metabolism in RBCs is characterized by O2-responsive variations in flux through the Embden Meyerhof pathway (EMP) or the hexose monophosphate pathway (HMP). Therefore, the generation of ATP, NADH, and 2,3-DPG (EMP) or NADPH (HMP) shift with RBC O2 content because of competition between deoxyhemoglobin and key EMP enzymes for binding to the cytoplasmic domain of the Band 3 membrane protein (cdB3). Enzyme inactivation by cdB3 sequestration in oxygenated RBCs favors HMP flux and NADPH generation (maximizing glutathione-based antioxidant systems). We tested the hypothesis that sickle hemoglobin disrupts cdB3-based regulatory protein complex assembly, creating vulnerability to oxidative stress. In RBCs from patients with sickle cell anemia, we demonstrate in the present study constrained HMP flux, NADPH, and glutathione recycling and reduced resilience to oxidative stress manifested by membrane protein oxidation and membrane fragility. Using a novel, inverted membrane-on-bead model, we illustrate abnormal (O2-dependent) association of sickle hemoglobin to RBC membrane that interferes with sequestration/inactivation of the EMP enzyme GAPDH. This finding was confirmed by immunofluorescent imaging during RBC O2 loading/unloading. Moreover, selective inhibition of inappropriately dispersed GAPDH rescues antioxidant capacity. Such disturbance of cdB3-based linkage between O2 gradients and RBC metabolism suggests a novel mechanism by which hypoxia may influence the sickle cell anemia phenotype.',

    Description: 'Qualitative metabolomics that describe red blood cell metabolism in AS-1 media.',
    Abstract:
      'Population-based investigations suggest that red blood cells (RBCs) are therapeutically effective when collected, processed, and stored for up to 42 days under validated conditions before transfusion. However, some retrospective clinical studies have shown worse patient outcomes when transfused RBCs have been stored for the longest times. Furthermore, studies of RBC persistence in the circulation after transfusion have suggested that considerable donor-to-donor variability exists and may affect transfusion efficacy. To understand the limitations of current blood storage technologies and to develop approaches to improve RBC storage and transfusion efficacy, we investigated the global metabolic alterations that occur when RBCs are stored in AS-1 (AS1-RBC). Leukoreduced AS1-RBC units prepared from 9 volunteer research donors (12 total donated units) were serially sampled for metabolomics analysis over 42 days of refrigerated storage. Samples were tested by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, and specific biochemical compounds were identified by comparison to a library of purified standards. Over 3 experiments, 185 to 264 defined metabolites were quantified in stored RBC samples. Kinetic changes in these biochemicals confirmed known alterations in glycolysis and other pathways previously identified in RBCs stored in saline, adenine, glucose and mannitol solution (SAGM-RBC). Furthermore, we identified additional alterations not previously seen in SAGM-RBCs (eg, stable pentose phosphate pathway flux, progressive decreases in oxidized glutathione), and we delineated changes occurring in other metabolic pathways not previously studied (eg, S-adenosyl methionine cycle). These data are presented in the context of a detailed comparison with previous studies of SAGM-RBCs from human donors and murine AS1-RBCs. Global metabolic profiling of AS1-RBCs revealed a number of biochemical alterations in stored blood that may affect RBC viability during storage as well as therapeutic effectiveness of stored RBCs in transfusion recipients. These results provide future opportunities to more clearly pinpoint the metabolic defects during RBC storage, to identify biomarkers for donor screening and prerelease RBC testing, and to develop improved RBC storage solutions and methodologies.',

      'Metabolomics is a rapidly evolving analytical approach in life and health sciences. The structural elucidation of the metabolites of interest remains a major analytical challenge in the metabolomics workflow. Here, we investigate the use of ion mobility as a tool to aid metabolite identification. Ion mobility allows for the measurement of the rotationally averaged collision cross-section (CCS), which gives information about the ionic shape of a molecule in the gas phase. We measured the CCSs of 125 common metabolites using traveling-wave ion mobility-mass spectrometry (TW-IM-MS). CCS measurements were highly reproducible on instruments located in three independent laboratories (RSD < 5% for 99%). We also determined the reproducibility of CCS measurements in various biological matrixes including urine, plasma, platelets, and red blood cells using ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with TW-IM-MS. The mean RSD was < 2% for 97% of the CCS values, compared to 80% of retention times. Finally, as proof of concept, we used UPLC-TW-IM-MS to compare the cellular metabolome of epithelial and mesenchymal cells, an in vitro model used to study cancer development. Experimentally determined and computationally derived CCS values were used as orthogonal analytical parameters in combination with retention time and accurate mass information to confirm the identity of key metabolites potentially involved in cancer. Thus, our results indicate that adding CCS data to searchable databases and to routine metabolomics workflows will increase the identification confidence compared to traditional analytical approaches.',

    Description: 'Examines whether deoxygenation had beneficial effects in terms of membrane proteome homeostasis and preserved osmotic resistance.',
    Abstract:
      'While prospective clinical trials are currently underway in several countries throughout the world, the safety and effectiveness of long-stored erythrocyte concentrates have been questioned by controversial retrospective clinical evidence and accumulating biochemical investigations. Laboratory investigations have recently highlighted that a significant number of biochemical and mechanical lesions accumulate in erythrocyte concentrates during their storage in the blood bank. These alterations, often referred to as "storage lesions", include: (i) the progressive impairment of cell metabolism, leading to the consumption of high energy phosphate compounds (ATP and 2,3-iphosphoglycerate); (ii) the accumulation of oxidative stress, resulting in the oxidation, non-enzymatic glycosylation, fragmentation or aggregation of the red blood cell (RBC) membrane and cytosolic proteins; (iii) the progressive loss of metabolic modulation, as a result of oxidative stress (especially in non-leucoreduced units) and protease activity-dependent fragmentation of the N-terminal cytosolic domain of band 3, which results in impairment of the regulatory function of the so-called "respiratory metabolon"; (iv) the progressive oxidation of lipids and deregulation of lipid homeostasis; (v) the exacerbation of membrane blebbing and shedding of microvesicles, a self-protective mechanism, closely mimicking apoptosis, which allows cells to get rid of no-longer functional or irreversibly altered proteins and lipids, while retaining rheological properties of the donor, which might result in pro-immunogenic potential in the recipient, together with newly appearing storage-dependent biomarkers promoting RBC phagocytosis, such as phosphatidylserine exposure; and (vi) microvesiculation events that compromise RBC morphology (changes from a discocytic to a spheroechnicocytic or spherocytic phenotype), which ends up impairing the surface-to-volume ratio, thereby increasing osmotic fragility, and increasing membrane rigidity, as a result of progressive leaching and intercalation of the plasticizers (such as DEHP) into the membrane lipid bilayer.',

      'Recent advances in red blood cell metabolomics have paved the way for further improvements of storage solutions. In the present study, we exploited a validated high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analytical workflow to determine the effects of vitamin C and N-acetylcysteine supplementation (anti-oxidants) on the metabolome of erythrocytes stored in citrate-phosphate-dextrose saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol medium under blood bank conditions. We observed decreased energy metabolism fluxes (glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway). A tentative explanation of this phenomenon could be related to the observed depression of the uptake of glucose, since glucose and ascorbate are known to compete for the same transporter. Anti-oxidant supplementation was effective in modulating the redox poise, through the promotion of glutathione homeostasis, which resulted in decreased haemolysis and less accumulation of malondialdehyde and oxidation by-products (including oxidized glutathione and prostaglandins). Anti-oxidants improved storage quality by coping with oxidative stress at the expense of glycolytic metabolism, although reservoirs of high energy phosphate compounds were preserved by reduced cyclic AMP-mediated release of ATP.',

DISCUSSION:\n                 Anti-oxidants improved storage quality by coping with\n                 oxidative stress at the expense of glycolytic metabolism,\n                 although reservoirs of high energy phosphate compounds were\n                 preserved by reduced cyclic AMP-mediated release of ATP.",\n  journal     = "Blood Transfus.",\n  volume      =  12,\n  number      =  3,\n  pages       = "376--387",\n  month       =  jul,\n  year        =  2014,\n  language    = "en"\n}\n',

    Abstract:
      'The metabolism of gluconate is well characterized in prokaryotes where it is known to be degraded following phosphorylation by gluconokinase. Less is known of gluconate metabolism in humans. Human gluconokinase activity was recently identified proposing questions about the metabolic role of gluconate in humans. Here we report the recombinant expression, purification and biochemical characterization of isoform I of human gluconokinase alongside substrate specificity and kinetic assays of the enzyme catalyzed reaction. The enzyme, shown to be a dimer, had ATP dependent phosphorylation activity and strict specificity towards gluconate out of 122 substrates tested. In order to evaluate the metabolic impact of gluconate in humans we modeled gluconate metabolism using steady state metabolic network analysis. The results indicate that significant metabolic flux changes in anabolic pathways linked to the hexose monophosphate shunt (HMS) are induced through a small increase in gluconate concentration. We argue that the enzyme takes part in a context specific carbon flux route into the HMS that, in humans, remains incompletely explored. Apart from the biochemical description of human gluconokinase, the results highlight that little is known of the mechanism of gluconate metabolism in humans despite its widespread use in medicine and consumer products.',

    Description:
      'A determination of the heritability of glutathione (GSH), glutathione disulfide (GSSG), the status of the GSSG,2H(+)/2GSH couple (Ehc), and total glutathione (tGSH) in donated RBCs over 56 days of storage.',
    Abstract:
      'Red blood cells (RBCs) collected for transfusion deteriorate during storage. This deterioration is termed the "RBC storage lesion." There is increasing concern over the safety, therapeutic efficacy, and toxicity of transfusing longer-stored units of blood. The severity of the RBC storage lesion is dependent on storage time and varies markedly between individuals. Oxidative damage is considered a significant factor in the development of the RBC storage lesion. In this study, the variability during storage and heritability of antioxidants and metabolites central to RBC integrity and function were investigated. In a classic twin study, we determined the heritability of glutathione (GSH), glutathione disulfide (GSSG), the status of the GSSG,2H(+)/2GSH couple (Ehc), and total glutathione (tGSH) in donated RBCs over 56 days of storage. Intracellular GSH and GSSG concentrations both decrease during storage (median net loss of 0.52 \u00b1 0.63 mM (median \u00b1 SD) and 0.032 \u00b1 0.107 mM, respectively, over 42 days). Taking into account the decline in pH, Ehc became more positive (oxidized) during storage (median net increase of 35 \u00b1 16 mV). In our study population heritability estimates for GSH, GSSG, tGSH, and Ehc measured over 56 days of storage are 79, 60, 67, and, 75%, respectively. We conclude that susceptibility of stored RBCs to oxidative injury due to variations in the GSH redox buffer is highly variable among individual donors and strongly heritable. Identifying the genes that regulate the storage-related changes in this redox buffer could lead to the development of new methods to minimize the RBC storage lesion.',

      'A review that discusses several challenges to generate in-depth red blood cell proteomics data that can result in the identification of biomarkers.',
    Abstract:
      'Red blood cells are rather unique body cells, since they have lost all organelles when mature, which results in lack of potential to replace proteins that have lost their function. They maintain only a few pathways for obtaining energy and reducing power for the key functions they need to fulfill. This makes RBCs highly sensitive to any aberration. If so, these RBCs are quickly removed from circulation, but if the RBC levels reduce extremely fast, this results in hemolytic anemia. Several causes of HA exist, and proteome analysis is the most straightforward way to obtain deeper insight into RBC functioning under the stress of disease. This should result in discovery of biomarkers, typical for each source of anemia. In this review, several challenges to generate in-depth RBC proteomes are described, like to obtain pure RBCs, to overcome the wide dynamic range in protein expression, and to establish which of the identified/quantified proteins are active in RBCs. The final challenge is to acquire and validate suited biomarkers unique for the changes that occur for each of the clinical questions; in red blood cell aging (also important for transfusion medicine), for thalassemias or sickle cell disease. Biomarkers for other hemolytic anemias that are caused by dysfunction of RBC membrane proteins (the RBC membrane defects) or RBC cytosolic proteins (the enzymopathies) are sometimes even harder to discover, in particular for the patients with RBC rare diseases with unknown cause.

    Description:
      'A reevaluation of the current paradigm regarding the efficacy of standard issue red blood cells during the hours after transfusion with respect to damage control resuscitation and remote damage control resuscitation.',
    Abstract:
      'The philosophy of damage control resuscitation (DCR) and remote damage control resuscitation (RDCR) can be summarized by stating that the goal is to prevent death from hemorrhagic shock by "staying out of trouble instead of getting out of trouble." In other words, it is preferred to arrest the progression of shock, rather than also having to reverse this condition after significant tissue damage and organ injury cascades are established. Moreover, to prevent death from exsanguination, a balanced approach to the treatment of both shock and coagulopathy is required. This was military doctrine during World War II, but seemed to be forgotten during the last half of the 20th century. Damage control resuscitation and RDCR have revitalized the approach, but there is still more to learn about the most effective and safe resuscitative strategies to simultaneously treat shock and hemorrhage. Current data suggest that our preconceived notions regarding the efficacy of standard issue red blood cells (RBCs) during the hours after transfusion may be false. Standard issue RBCs may not increase oxygen delivery and may in fact decrease it by disturbing control of regional blood flow distribution (impaired nitric oxide processing) and failing to release oxygen, even when perfusing hypoxic tissue (abnormal oxygen affinity). Standard issue RBCs may assist with hemostasis but appear to have competing effects on thrombin generation and platelet function. If standard issue or RBCs of increased storage age are not optimal, then are there alternatives that will allow for an efficacious and safe treatment of shock while also supporting hemostasis? Studies are required to determine if fresh RBCs less than 7 to 10 days provide an outcome advantage. A resurgence in the study of whole blood stored at 4\u00b0C for up to 10 days also holds promise. Two randomized controlled trials in humans have indicated that following transfusion with either whole blood stored at 4\u00b0C or platelets stored at 4\u00b0C there was less clinical bleeding than when blood was reconstituted with components or when platelets were stored at 22\u00b0C. Early reversal of shock is essential to prevent exacerbation of coagulopathy and progression of cell death cascades in patients with severe traumatic injuries. Red blood cell storage solutions have evolved to accommodate the needs of non-critically ill patients yet may not be optimal for patients in hemorrhagic shock. Continued focus on the recognition and treatment of shock is essential for continued improvement in outcomes for patients who require damage control resuscitation and RDCR.',

Moreover, to prevent death from\n                 exsanguination, a balanced approach to the treatment of both\n                 shock and coagulopathy is required. This was military doctrine\n                 during World War II, but seemed to be forgotten during the\n                 last half of the 20th century. Damage control resuscitation\n                 and RDCR have revitalized the approach, but there is still\n                 more to learn about the most effective and safe resuscitative\n                 strategies to simultaneously treat shock and hemorrhage.\n                 Current data suggest that our preconceived notions regarding\n                 the efficacy of standard issue red blood cells (RBCs) during\n                 the hours after transfusion may be false. Standard issue RBCs\n                 may not increase oxygen delivery and may in fact decrease it\n                 by disturbing control of regional blood flow distribution\n                 (impaired nitric oxide processing) and failing to release\n                 oxygen, even when perfusing hypoxic tissue (abnormal oxygen\n                 affinity). Standard issue RBCs may assist with hemostasis but\n                 appear to have competing effects on thrombin generation and\n                 platelet function. If standard issue or RBCs of increased\n                 storage age are not optimal, then are there alternatives that\n                 will allow for an efficacious and safe treatment of shock\n                 while also supporting hemostasis? Studies are required to\n                 determine if fresh RBCs less than 7 to 10 days provide an\n                 outcome advantage.

    Abstract:
      'In most countries, red blood cells (RBCs) can be stored up to 42 days before transfusion. However, observational studies have suggested that storage duration might be associated with increased morbidity and mortality. While clinical trials are under way, impaired metabolism has been documented in RBCs stored in several additive solutions (ASs). Here we hypothesize that, despite reported beneficial effects, storage in AS-3 results in metabolic impairment weeks before the end of the unit shelf life. Five leukofiltered AS-3 RBC units were sampled before, during, and after leukoreduction Day\u20090 and then assayed on a weekly basis from storage Day\u20091 through Day\u200942. RBC extracts and supernatants were assayed using a ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography separations coupled online with mass spectrometry detection metabolomics workflow. Blood bank storage significantly affects metabolic profiles of RBC extracts and supernatants by Day\u200914. In addition to energy and redox metabolism impairment, intra- and extracellular accumulation of amino acids was observed proportionally to storage duration, suggesting a role for glutamine and serine metabolism in aging RBCs. Metabolomics of stored RBCs could drive the introduction of alternative ASs to address some of the storage-dependent metabolic lesions herein reported, thereby increasing the quality of transfused RBCs and minimizing potential links to patient morbidity.',

    Description: 'An examination of the storage quality of red blood cells stored in AS-7.',
    Abstract:
      'Transfusion of long-stored red blood cells (RBCs) is associated with decreased in vivo RBC recovery, delivery of RBC breakdown products, and increased morbidity and mortality. Reducing the burden of this RBC "storage lesion" is a major challenge in transfusion medicine. Additive solution-7 (AS-7) is a new RBC storage solution designed to improve RBC metabolism by providing phosphate and increasing buffering capacity. Storage quality in AS-7 was measured in a prospective, randomized, three-center trial using units of whole blood from healthy human subjects whose RBCs were stored for up to 56 days in AS-7 (n = 120) or for 42 days in the control solution AS-1 (n = 60). Hemolysis and shedding of protein-containing microvesicles were significantly reduced in RBCs stored in AS-7 for 42 and 56 days compared with RBCs stored in AS-1. Autologous in vivo recoveries of RBCs stored in AS-7 was 88 \u00b1 5% at 42 days (n = 27) and 82 \u00b1 3% at 56 days (n = 27), exceeding recoveries of RBCs stored in currently used solutions. Increasing the phosphate, pH range, and buffer capacity of a RBC storage system allowed RBCs to be stored better and longer than currently approved storage systems. AS-7 ameliorates the long-term storage lesion resulting in significantly increased viability in vitro and in vivo.',

    Abstract:
      "Red blood cell (RBC) aging in the blood bank is characterized by the accumulation of a significant number of biochemical and morphologic alterations. Recent mass spectrometry and electron microscopy studies have provided novel insights into the molecular changes underpinning the accumulation of storage lesions to RBCs in the blood bank. Biochemical lesions include altered cation homeostasis, reprogrammed energy, and redox metabolism, which result in the impairment of enzymatic activity and progressive depletion of high-energy phosphate compounds. These factors contribute to the progressive accumulation of oxidative stress, which in turn promotes oxidative lesions to proteins (carbonylation, fragmentation, hemoglobin glycation) and lipids (peroxidation). Biochemical lesions negatively affect RBC morphology, which is marked by progressive membrane blebbing and vesiculation. These storage lesions contribute to the altered physiology of long-stored RBCs and promote the rapid clearance of up to one-fourth of long-stored RBCs from the recipient's bloodstream after 24 hours from administration. While prospective clinical evidence is accumulating, from the present review it emerges that biochemical, morphologic, and omics profiles of stored RBCs have observable changes after approximately 14 days of storage. Future studies will assess whether these in vitro observations might have clinically meaningful effects.",

      'An investigation of how much the dispersion forces contribute to active ion pumps in an erythrocyte (red blood cell) as well as the correction of chemical potential reference states between intracellular and extracellular environments.',
    Abstract:
      'In virtually all mammal cells, we can observe a much higher concentration of potassium ions inside the cell and vice versa for sodium ions. Classical theories ignore the specific ion effects and the difference in the thermodynamic reference states between intracellular and extracellular environments. Usually, this differential ion partitioning across a cell membrane is attributed exclusively to the active ion transport. Our aim is to investigate how much the dispersion forces contribute to active ion pumps in an erythrocyte (red blood cell) as well as the correction of chemical potential reference states between intracellular and extracellular environments. The ionic partition and the membrane potential in an erythrocyte are analyzed by the modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation, considering nonelectrostatic interactions between ions and macromolecules. Results show that the nonelectrostatic potential calculated by Lifshitz theory has only a small influence with respect to the high concentration of K(+) in the intracellular environment in comparison with Na(+).',

    Description: 'Qualitative metabolomics data that describes energy and redox metabolism for red blood cells stored in AS-7 media.',
    Abstract:
      'Storage and transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) has a huge medical and economic impact. Routine storage practices can be ameliorated through the implementation of novel additive solutions (ASs) that tackle the accumulation of biochemical and morphologic lesion during routine cold liquid storage in the blood bank, such as the recently introduced alkaline solution AS-7. Here we hypothesize that AS-7 might exert its beneficial effects through metabolic modulation during routine storage. Apheresis RBCs were resuspended either in control AS-3 or experimental AS-7, before ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics analysis. Unambiguous assignment and relative quantitation was achieved for 229 metabolites. AS-3 and AS-7 results in many similar metabolic trends over storage, with AS-7 RBCs being more metabolically active in the first storage week. AS-7 units had faster fueling of the pentose phosphate pathway, higher total glutathione pools, and increased flux through glycolysis as indicated by higher levels of pathway intermediates. Metabolite differences are especially observed at 7 days of storage, but were still maintained throughout 42 days. AS-7 formulation (chloride free and bicarbonate loading) appears to improve energy and redox metabolism in stored RBCs in the early storage period, and the differences, though diminished, are still appreciable by Day 42. Energy metabolism and free fatty acids should be investigated as potentially important determinants for preservation of RBC structure and function. Future studies will be aimed at identifying metabolites that correlate with in vitro and in vivo circulation times.',

    Description: 'A review of red blood cell physiology relevant to disordered oxygen delivery in the critically ill.',
    Abstract:
      'Oxygen (O2) delivery, the maintenance of which is fundamental to supporting those with critical illness, is a function of blood O2 content and flow. Here, we review red blood cell (RBC) physiology relevant to disordered O2 delivery in the critically ill. Flow (rather than content) is the focus of O2 delivery regulation. O2 content is relatively fixed, whereas flow fluctuates by several orders of magnitude. Thus, blood flow volume and distribution vary to maintain coupling between O2 delivery and demand. The trapping, processing and delivery of nitric oxide (NO) by RBCs has emerged as a conserved mechanism through which regional blood flow is linked to biochemical cues of perfusion sufficiency. We will review conventional RBC physiology that influences O2 delivery (O2 affinity & rheology) and introduce a new paradigm for O2 delivery homeostasis based on coordinated gas transport and vascular signaling by RBCs. By coordinating vascular signaling in a fashion that links O2 and NO flux, RBCs couple vessel caliber (and thus blood flow) to O2 need in tissue. Malfunction of this signaling system is implicated in a wide array of pathophysiologies and may be explanatory for the dysoxia frequently encountered in the critical care setting.',

      'Understanding individual variation is fundamental to personalized medicine. Yet interpreting complex phenotype data, such as multi-compartment metabolomic profiles, in the context of genotype data for an individual is complicated by interactions within and between cells and remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we constructed multi-omic, data-driven, personalized whole-cell kinetic models of erythrocyte metabolism for 24 healthy individuals based on fasting-state plasma and erythrocyte metabolomics and whole-genome genotyping. We show that personalized kinetic rate constants, rather than metabolite levels, better represent the genotype. Additionally, changes in erythrocyte dynamics between individuals occur on timescales of circulation, suggesting detected differences play a role in physiology. Finally, we use the models to identify individuals at risk for a drug side effect (ribavirin-induced anemia) and how genetic variation (inosine triphosphatase deficiency) may protect against this side effect. This study demonstrates the feasibility of personalized kinetic models, and we anticipate their use will accelerate discoveries in characterizing individual metabolic variation.',

      'A review that summarizes the red blood cell storage lesion and outlines the biological and clinical consequences of increasing storage time of red blood cells.',
    Abstract:
      'To summarize current understanding of the mechanisms responsible for changes occurring during red blood cell (RBC) storage, collectively known as the storage lesion, and to review the biological and clinical consequences of increasing storage time of RBCs. Human and veterinary clinical studies, experimental animal model studies, and reviews of the RBC storage lesion with no date restrictions. Experimental studies have characterized the evolution of human RBC and supernatant changes that occur during storage and form the basis for concern about the potential for harm from long-term storage of RBCs. Although 4 randomized controlled trials of varying sizes failed to find an association between RBC storage time and negative clinical outcomes, a recent meta-analysis and numerous observational clinical studies have demonstrated that transfusion of old versus fresh stored RBCs is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, particularly among trauma victims and cardiac surgery patients. Potential clinical consequences of RBC transfusion following development of the storage lesion include risk of organ dysfunction, organ failure, infections, and death. Experimental animal models have contributed to the evidence supporting adverse consequences of the RBC storage lesion. Studies on relevant RBC storage issues such as the effect of different preservative solutions and leukoreduction have been completed. Transfusion with RBCs stored for 42 days increases mortality in dogs with experimental sepsis. Storage of RBCs induces progressive biochemical, biomechanical, and immunologic changes that affect red cell viability, deformability, oxygen carrying capacity, microcirculatory flow, and recipient response. Most reports in the human and veterinary literature support the concept that there are deleterious effects of the RBC storage lesion, but additional studies with improved experimental design are needed to identify compelling reasons to modify current blood banking and transfusion practices.',

      'An examination of oxidized peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) under storage conditions, suggesting that Prx2 could be used as a biomarker for the quality of stored red blood cells.',
    Abstract:
      'The thiol protein peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) is a major red blood cell (RBC) antioxidant that breaks down hydroperoxides and in the process is converted to an oxidized disulfide. Our objective was to determine whether Prx2 becomes oxidized during storage of RBCs, to understand the underlying mechanism, and to find ways of preventing the accumulation of the oxidized form. RBCs were stored for up to 6 weeks under simulated blood banking conditions and Prx2 oxidation was monitored by nonreducing gel electrophoresis. The ability of the cells to reverse Prx2 oxidation after storage and to respond to added hydrogen peroxide was also evaluated. Prx2 remained predominantly reduced during the first 3 weeks of storage, and then the oxidized form accumulated progressively. In contrast to fresh cells, oxidation was not reversed by incubation with glucose. Storage of RBCs in a high-pH, low-chloride, and high-phosphate/bicarbonate buffer (EAS-76v6) largely prevented accumulation of oxidized Prx for at least 6 weeks, and dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), but not Rejuvesol, N-acetylcysteine, or \u03b1-lipoic acid, was able to reverse or protect against Prx2 oxidation. Additional, Prx2 oxidation occurred when hydrogen peroxide was added. However, this was reversible, suggesting that the reductive capacity was compromised in some but not in all cells. Prx2 remains mostly reduced in a high-pH storage solution with buffering capacity. Addition of DHLA to stored RBCs might be advantageous. Prx2 redox status could be used as a biomarker for the quality of stored RBCs.',

      'Overnight, room temperature hold (ONH) of whole blood before component processing offers several benefits. This study evaluated the storage and in vivo recovery characteristics of ONH red blood cells (RBCs) stored in additive solution-7 (AS-7). We conducted a three-center, three-arm evaluation of a new blood collection system with AS-7 compared to leukoreduced RBCs processed within 8 hours and stored in AS-1 (control). Whole blood (500 \u00b1 50 mL) from healthy research subjects (n = 240) was held at room temperature 0 to 2 hours, 6 to 8 hours, or ONH (18-24 hr) before component processing and storage at 1 to 6 \u00b0C. RBCs were evaluated on Days 42 and 56 with a panel of in vitro assays. Subsets of the AS-7-stored RBCs were evaluated for (51) Cr 24-hour in vivo recovery and long-term survival. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in ONH RBCs were not different than AS-7 RBCs prepared within 8 hours. ATP was higher in the ONH group on Day 42 than control, and ATP was maintained in all AS-7 groups through Day 56. ONH units had 0.36 \u00b1 0.14% on Day 42 hemolysis (60/60 < 0.8%), and 0.54 \u00b1 0.22% on Day 56 (10/60 > 0.8%, 2/60 > 1%). In vivo recoveries of stored RBCs were not different between the AS-7 arms at 42 days (p = 0.16; 27/27 ONH units > 75%), but the Day 56 ONH was significantly less than ONH on Day 42 (p = 0.008; 7/28 < 75%).

      'An exploration of the biochemical components of the storage lesion that are correlated with the ability of stored red blood cells to circulate post transfusion.',
    Abstract:
      'Transfusion of red blood cells is a very common inpatient procedure, with more than 1 in 70 people in the USA receiving a red blood cell transfusion annually. However, stored red blood cells are a non-uniform product, based upon donor-to-donor variation in red blood cell storage biology. While thousands of biological parameters change in red blood cells over storage, it has remained unclear which changes correlate with function of the red blood cells, as opposed to being co-incidental changes. In the current report, a murine model of red blood cell storage/transfusion is applied across 13 genetically distinct mouse strains and combined with high resolution metabolomics to identify metabolic changes that correlated with red blood cell circulation post storage. Oxidation in general, and peroxidation of lipids in particular, emerged as changes that correlated with extreme statistical significance, including generation of dicarboxylic acids and monohydroxy fatty acids. In addition, differences in anti-oxidant pathways known to regulate oxidative stress on lipid membranes were identified. Finally, metabolites were identified that differed at the time the blood was harvested, and predict how the red blood cells perform after storage, allowing the potential to screen donors at time of collection.

    Description:
      'A comparison of the rheological properties of conventionally and anaerobically stored RBC and provide a measure of the relationship between oxidative damage to stored RBC and their ability to perfuse microvascular networks.',
    Abstract:
      'Hypothermic storage of red blood cells (RBCs) results in progressive deterioration of the rheological properties of the cells, which may reduce the efficacy of RBC transfusions. Recent studies have suggested that storing RBC units under anaerobic conditions may reduce this storage-induced deterioration. The aim of this study was to compare the rheological properties of conventionally and anaerobically stored RBC and provide a measure of the relationship between oxidative damage to stored RBC and their ability to perfuse microvascular networks. Three different microfluidic devices were used to measure the ability of both types of stored RBC to perfuse artificial microvascular networks. Flow rates of the RBC passing through the entire network (bulk perfusion) and the individual capillaries (capillary perfusion) of the devices were measured on days 2, 21, 42, and 63 of storage. The bulk perfusion rates for anaerobically stored RBC were significantly higher than for conventionally stored RBCs over the entire duration of storage for all devices (up to 10% on day 42; up to 14% on day 63). Capillary perfusion rates suggested that anaerobically stored RBC units contained significantly fewer non-deformable RBC capable of transiently plugging microfluidic device capillaries. The number of plugging events caused by these non-deformable RBC increased over the 63 days of hypothermic storage by nearly 16- to 21-fold for conventionally stored units, and by only about 3- to 6-fold for anaerobically stored units. The perfusion measurements suggest that anaerobically stored RBC retain a greater ability to perfuse networks of artificial capillaries compared to conventionally (aerobically) stored RBC. It is likely that anaerobic storage confers this positive effect on the bulk mechanical properties of stored RBC by significantly reducing the number of non-deformable cells present in the overall population of relatively well-preserved RBC.',

    Description:
      'A comparison of the local transient response properties of dynamic models constructed using rate laws with varying levels of approximation.',
    Abstract:
      'The mechanistic description of enzyme kinetics in a dynamic model of metabolism requires specifying the numerical values of a large number of kinetic parameters. The parameterization challenge is often addressed through the use of simplifying approximations to form reaction rate laws with reduced numbers of parameters. Whether such simplified models can reproduce dynamic characteristics of the full system is an important question. In this work, we compared the local transient response properties of dynamic models constructed using rate laws with varying levels of approximation. These approximate rate laws were: 1) a Michaelis-Menten rate law with measured enzyme parameters, 2) a Michaelis-Menten rate law with approximated parameters, using the convenience kinetics convention, 3) a thermodynamic rate law resulting from a metabolite saturation assumption, and 4) a pure chemical reaction mass action rate law that removes the role of the enzyme from the reaction kinetics. We utilized in vivo data for the human red blood cell to compare the effect of rate law choices against the backdrop of physiological flux and concentration differences. We found that the Michaelis-Menten rate law with measured enzyme parameters yields an excellent approximation of the full system dynamics, while other assumptions cause greater discrepancies in system dynamic behavior. However, iteratively replacing mechanistic rate laws with approximations resulted in a model that retains a high correlation with the true model behavior. Investigating this consistency, we determined that the order of magnitude differences among fluxes and concentrations in the network were greatly influential on the network dynamics. We further identified reaction features such as thermodynamic reversibility, high substrate concentration, and lack of allosteric regulation, which make certain reactions more suitable for rate law approximations. Overall, our work generally supports the use of approximate rate laws when building large scale kinetic models, due to the key role that physiologically meaningful flux and concentration ranges play in determining network dynamics. However, we also showed that detailed mechanistic models show a clear benefit in prediction accuracy when data is available. The work here should help to provide guidance to future kinetic modeling efforts on the choice of rate law and parameterization approaches.',

    Abstract:
      'Transfusion of packed red blood cells (RBC) is a life-saving intervention for millions of people worldwide. Thorough statistical review of 31 randomised clinical trials concluded that, while "restrictive transfusion strategies are safe in most clinical settings, liberal transfusion strategies have not been shown to confer any benefit to patients but have the potential for harm". Though randomised clinical trials performed so far have not highlighted a major association between storage duration and mortality, the studies may have been underpowered to appreciate minor (<5%), but still significant effects (in terms of numbers of patients) on morbidity. Despite the lack of definitive clinical evidence, recent laboratory studies have shown that biochemical alterations to packed RBC progressively accumulate during routine storage in the blood bank. While the clinical relevance of such alterations is uncertain, the lesions to RBC during routine storage in the blood bank might be potentially harmful to massively or chronically transfused recipients, as might be exposure to plasticisers.',

    Description:
      'Identification of eight extracellular storage-age metabolite biomarkers (adenine, glucose, hypoxanthine, lactate, malate, nicotinamide, 5-oxoproline, and xanthine) for the human red blood cell.',
    Abstract:
      'Metabolomic investigations of packed red blood cells (RBCs) stored under refrigerated conditions in saline adenine glucose mannitol (SAGM) additives have revealed the presence of 3 distinct metabolic phases, occurring on days 0-10, 10-18, and after day 18 of storage. Here we used receiving operating characteristics curve analysis to identify biomarkers that can differentiate between the 3 metabolic states. We first recruited 24 donors and analyzed 308 samples coming from RBC concentrates stored in SAGM and additive solution 3. We found that 8 extracellular compounds (lactic acid, nicotinamide, 5-oxoproline, xanthine, hypoxanthine, glucose, malic acid, and adenine) form the basis for an accurate classification/regression model and are able to differentiate among the metabolic phases. This model was then validated by analyzing an additional 49 samples obtained by preparing 7 new RBC concentrates in SAGM. Despite the technical variability associated with RBC processing strategies, verification of these markers was independently confirmed in 2 separate laboratories with different analytical setups and different sample sets. The 8 compounds proposed here highly correlate with the metabolic age of packed RBCs, and can be prospectively validated as biomarkers of the RBC metabolic lesion.',

    Description:
      'A deep-coverage time-course endo- and exo-metabolomics dataset that provides 3-4 day resolution for the human red blood under cold storage for use in transfusion medicine.',
    Abstract:
      'There has been interest in determining whether older red blood cell (RBC) units have negative clinical effects. Numerous observational studies have shown that older RBC units are an independent factor for patient mortality. However, recently published randomized clinical trials have shown no difference of clinical outcome for patients receiving old or fresh RBCs. An overlooked but essential issue in assessing RBC unit quality and ultimately designing the necessary clinical trials is a metric for what constitutes an old or fresh RBC unit. Twenty RBC units were profiled using quantitative metabolomics over 42 days of storage in SAGM with 3- to 4-day time intervals. Metabolic pathway usage during storage was assessed using systems biology methods. The detected time intervals of the metabolic states were compared to clinical outcomes. Using multivariate statistics, we identified a nonlinear decay process exhibiting three distinct metabolic states (Days 0-10, 10-17, and 17-42). Hematologic variables traditionally measured in the transfusion setting (e.g., pH, hemolysis, RBC indices) did not distinguish these three states. Systemic changes in pathway usage occurred between the three states, with key pathways changing in both magnitude and direction. Finally, an association was found between the time periods of the metabolic states with the clinical outcomes of more than 280,000 patients in the country of Denmark transfused over the past 15 years and endothelial damage markers in healthy volunteers undergoing autologous transfusions. The state of RBC metabolism may be a better indicator of cellular quality than traditional hematologic variables.',

    Description: 'A review that catalogues and describes metabolomics data for human red blood cells under storage conditions.',
    Abstract:
      'Biochemical investigations on the regulatory mechanisms of red blood cell (RBC) and platelet (PLT) metabolism have fostered a century of advances in the field of transfusion medicine. Owing to these advances, storage of RBCs and PLT concentrates has become a lifesaving practice in clinical and military settings. There, however, remains room for improvement, especially with regard to the introduction of novel storage and/or rejuvenation solutions, alternative cell processing strategies (e.g., pathogen inactivation technologies), and quality testing (e.g., evaluation of novel containers with alternative plasticizers). Recent advancements in mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and systems biology, the bioinformatics integration of omics data, promise to speed up the design and testing of innovative storage strategies developed to improve the quality, safety, and effectiveness of blood products. Here we review the currently available metabolomics technologies and briefly describe the routine workflow for transfusion medicine-relevant studies. The goal is to provide transfusion medicine experts with adequate tools to navigate through the otherwise overwhelming amount of metabolomics data burgeoning in the field during the past few years. Descriptive metabolomics data have represented the first step omics researchers have taken into the field of transfusion medicine. However, to up the ante, clinical and omics experts will need to merge their expertise to investigate correlative and mechanistic relationships among metabolic variables and transfusion-relevant variables, such as 24-hour in vivo recovery for transfused RBCs. Integration with systems biology models will potentially allow for in silico prediction of metabolic phenotypes, thus streamlining the design and testing of alternative storage strategies and/or solutions.',

      'A retrospective analysis of 28,247 transfused patients that assesses morbidity, mortality, and length of stay for old and young blood.',
    Abstract:
      'Clinical trials have shown that longer red blood cell (RBC) storage duration does not worsen outcomes; however, these studies included few RBCs near the end of the 42-day storage limit. We tested the hypothesis that these "oldest" RBCs are associated with adverse outcomes. In a retrospective study, 28,247 transfused patients given 129,483 RBC units were assessed. Morbidity, mortality, and length of stay (LOS) were compared in patients transfused exclusively with RBCs stored not more than 21 days versus patients transfused exclusively with RBCs stored 28 days or more and patients transfused exclusively with RBCs stored 35 days or more. After risk adjustment, \u226535-day RBCs were associated with increased morbidity (adjusted odds ratio [adjOR], 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.32; p = 0.002), but \u226528-day RBCs were not (adjOR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.97-1.15; p = 0.2). Neither \u226535-day nor \u226528-day RBCs were associated with increased mortality. In critically ill patients, \u226535-day RBCs were associated with increased morbidity (adjOR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.08-1.44; p = 0.002) and mortality (adjOR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.08-1.74; p = 0.009), but \u226528-day RBCs were associated with neither. In older patients, \u226535-day RBCs were associated with increased morbidity (adjOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.04-1.42; p = 0.01), but not mortality (adjOR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.96-1.71; p = 0.1), and \u226528-day RBCs were associated with neither. LOS was increased for both \u226528- and \u226535-day RBCs for all patients and the critically ill and older subgroups. RBCs transfused in the last 7 days of their 42-day storage limit may be associated with adverse clinical outcomes in high-risk patients.',

    Abstract:
      'The red blood cell (RBC) storage lesion refers to the series of biochemical, metabolic, and structural changes that occur when RBCs are stored ex vivo. A century has passed since the development by Rous and Turner of the first solution permitting rabbit RBCs biopreservation and their accurate prediction that \u201cThe indications are that kept human cells could be profitably employed in the same way.\u201d Since the demonstration that transfusion of stored whole blood saved lives in World War I, key advances in RBC biopreservation have included the development of several anticoagulant and additive solutions (ASs), controlled refrigeration, and sterile disposable plastic bags that allow RBC components to be stored and available to patients in need for up to 42 days in the United States. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements are few and, in brief, include demonstrating that on average at 42 days of storage, more than 75% of autologous RBCs survive 24 hours in vivo when transfused back to healthy donors and that there is less than 1% hemolysis in the bag. These particular variables that were developed before clinical outcome studies of RBCs of different storage age were performed do not speak to the nature of the storage lesion elements and quality of RBCs nor to the effectiveness of RBC transfusions in different patient populations.',

    Abstract:
      'Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds have yet to be examined in large randomized trials in hematologic malignancies. This pilot study in acute leukemia uses a restrictive compared to a liberal transfusion strategy. A randomized (2:1) study was conducted of restrictive (LOW) hemoglobin (Hb) trigger (7 g/dL) compared to higher (HIGH) Hb trigger (8 g/dL). The primary outcome was feasibility of conducting a larger trial. The four requirements for success required that more than 50% of the eligible patients could be consented, more than 75% of the patients randomized to the LOW arm tolerated the transfusion trigger, fewer than 15% of patients crossed over from the LOW arm to the HIGH arm, and no indication for the need to pause the study for safety concerns. Secondary outcomes included fatigue, bleeding, and RBCs and platelets transfused. Ninety patients were consented and randomly assigned to LOW to HIGH. The four criteria for the primary objective of feasibility were met. When the number of units transfused was compared, adjusting for baseline Hb, the LOW arm was transfused on average 8.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.9-9.1) units/patient while the HIGH arm received 11.7 (95% CI, 10.1-13.2) units (p\u2009=\u20090.0003). There was no significant difference in bleeding events or neutropenic fevers between study arms. This study establishes feasibility for trial of Hb thresholds in leukemia through demonstration of success in all primary outcome metrics and a favorable safety profile. This population requires further study to evaluate the equivalence of liberal and restrictive transfusion thresholds in this unique clinical setting.',

    Abstract:
      'Although patient blood management (PBM) programs clearly reduce transfusion overuse, the relative impact on red blood cell (RBC), plasma, and platelet (PLT) utilization is unclear. A retrospective analysis of electronic records was conducted at a medium-sized academic hospital to assess blood utilization for all inpatients admitted during 1-year periods before (n\u2009=\u200920,531) and after (n\u2009=\u200919,477) PBM efforts began in September 2014. Transfusion guideline compliance and overall utilization were assessed for RBCs, plasma, and PLTs. The primary PBM efforts included education on evidence-based transfusion guidelines, decision support in the computerized provider order entry system, and distribution of provider-specific reports showing comparison to peers for guideline compliance. Cost avoidance was determined by two methods (acquisition cost and activity-based cost), and clinical outcomes were compared during the two periods. For RBCs, orders outside hospital guidelines decreased (from 23.9% to 17.1%, p < 0.001), and utilization decreased by 12% (p < 0.035). For plasma and PLTs, both orders outside guidelines and utilization changed minimally. Overall cost avoidance was $181,887/year by acquisition cost (and from $582,039 to $873,058/year by activity-based cost), 93% of which was attributed to reduction in RBC utilization. Length of stay, morbidity, and mortality were unchanged. Our findings demonstrate a greater opportunity for reducing RBC compared to plasma and PLT utilization. A properly implemented PBM program has potential to reduce unnecessary transfusions and their associated risk and costs, without compromising clinical outcomes.',

    Description: 'An editorial on the age of stored blood for use in transfusion medicine.',
    Abstract:
      'Since the advent of clinical blood transfusions early in the 20th century, transfusion medicine has evolved dramatically. The findings that anticoagulant and preservative solutions can prevent clotting so that blood could be stored before transfusion substantially enhanced the ease, feasibility, and safety of transfusions. These advances permitted the storage of red-cell units for up to 42 days rather than the need to transfuse fresh blood. However, now one of the major controversies regarding transfusion therapy is whether older blood is harmful, owing to a red-cell \u201cstorage lesion.\u201d In vitro data have shown that red cells that are stored for increased periods of time have decreased 2,3-diphosphoglycerate levels, decreased nitric oxide metabolism, impaired deformability, and increased endothelial adherence; in addition, the storage medium may have increased levels of free hemoglobin, free iron, and inflammatory mediators. Studies in animal models have suggested that older blood may worsen the consequences of bacterial infection. The debate over the duration of red-cell storage intensified after the Journal published a retrospective study of patients undergoing cardiac surgery suggesting that the use of older red cells was associated with increased mortality.',

    Description: 'Qualitative metabolomics data for red blood cells under adenine supplementation and the addition of isotopically-labeled adenine.',
    Abstract:
      "Red blood cells (RBCs) are routinely stored and transfused worldwide. Recently, metabolomics have shown that RBCs experience a three-phase metabolic decay process during storage, resulting in the definition of three distinct metabolic phenotypes, occurring between Days 1 and 10, 11 and 17, and 18 and 46. Here we use metabolomics and stable isotope labeling analysis to study adenine metabolism in RBCs. A total of 6 units were prepared in SAGM or modified additive solutions (ASs) containing 15 N5 -adenine. Three of them were spiked with 15 N5 -adenine on Days 10, 14, and 17 during storage. Each unit was sampled 10 times spanning Day 1 to Day 32. At each time point metabolic profiling was performed. We increased adenine concentration in the AS and we pulsed the adenine concentration during storage and found that in both cases the RBCs' main metabolic pathways were not affected. Our data clearly show that RBCs cannot consume adenine after 18 days of storage, even if it is still present in the storage solution. However, increased levels of adenine influenced S-adenosylmethionine metabolism. In this work, we have studied in detail the metabolic fate of adenine during RBC storage in SAGM. Adenine is one of the main substrates used by RBCs, but the metabolic shift observed during storage is not caused by an absence of adenine later in storage. The rate of adenine consumption strongly correlated with duration of storage but not with the amount of adenine present in the AS.",

    Abstract:
      'Anaerobic red blood cell (RBC) storage reduces oxidative damage, maintains adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) levels, and has superior 24-hour recovery at 6 weeks compared to standard storage. This study will determine if removal of CO2 during O2 depletion by gas exchange may affect RBCs during anaerobic storage. This is a matched three-arm study (n\u2009=\u200914): control, O2 and CO2 depleted with Ar (AN), and O2 depleted with 95%Ar/5%CO2 (AN[CO2 ]). RBCs in additives AS-3 or OFAS-3 were evenly divided into three bags, and anaerobic conditions were established by gas exchange. Bags were stored at 1 to 6\u00b0C in closed chambers under anaerobic conditions or ambient air, sampled weekly for up to 9 weeks for a panel of in vitro tests. A full metabolomics screening was conducted for the first 4 weeks of storage. Purging with Ar (AN) results in alkalization of the RBC and increased glucose consumption. The addition of 5% CO2 to the purging gas prevented CO2 loss with an equivalent starting and final pH and lactate to control bags (p\u2009>\u20090.5, Days 0-21). ATP levels are higher in AN[CO2 ] (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). DPG was maintained beyond 2 weeks in the AN arm (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Surprisingly, DPG was lost at the same rate in both control and AN[CO2 ] arms (p\u2009=\u20090.6). Maintenance of ATP in the AN[CO2 ] arm demonstrates that ATP production is not solely a function of the pH effect on glycolysis. CO2 in anaerobic storage prevented the maintenance of DPG, and DPG production appears to be pH dependent. CO2 as well as O2 depletion provides metabolic advantage for stored RBCs.',

      'An analytical platform comprising nano-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled online with tandem MS and refined database searches to identify progressive oxidation of Hb at key functional residues.',
    Abstract:
      'Routine storage of red blood cells (RBCs) results in the progressive accumulation of storage lesions. While the clinical relevance of these lesions is still a matter of debate, alterations to RBC morphology and biochemistry, especially in terms of energy and redox homeostasis, are likely to affect RBC physiology and functionality at a minimum. Identification of oxidative modifications that accumulate on key RBC proteins will help bridge the gap between storage induced alterations and post-transfusion RBC viability. Five AS-3 units were analyzed during routine storage via one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-nano-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled online with tandem mass spectrometry and advanced database searches. We identified oxidative modifications to functional residues of hemoglobin (Hb) beta chain, including proximal histidine, cysteine beta 94 (counting initiator methionine in the sequence), and histidine 144. Semiquantitative analysis indicates that up to approximately 20% of total Hb could be targeted by these oxidative modifications that are overlooked by standard proteomics approaches using routine database search conditions. Progressive accumulation of oxidized residues in stored RBCs and selective accumulation in vesicles was observed, further substantiating the hypothesis that vesiculation represents a self-protective mechanism in ageing RBCs. Several of the oxidized residues identified play well-established roles in heme iron coordination, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate binding, and nitric oxide homeostasis. Further functional and structural studies are necessary to determine possible associations between these modifications and impaired gas transport homeostasis in RBCs from old units.',

      'A screening of 2,756 variants that demonstrated endogenous enhancer activity across multiple massively parallel reporter assay fuctional variants.',
    Abstract:
      'Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of associations between common genetic variants and human disease phenotypes, but the majority of these variants are non-coding, often requiring genetic fine-mapping, epigenomic profiling, and individual reporter assays to delineate potential causal variants. We employ a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to simultaneously screen 2,756 variants in strong linkage disequilibrium with 75 sentinel variants associated with red blood cell traits. We show that this assay identifies elements with endogenous erythroid regulatory activity. Across 23 sentinel variants, we conservatively identified 32 MPRA functional variants (MFVs). We used targeted genome editing to demonstrate endogenous enhancer activity across 3 MFVs that predominantly affect the transcription of SMIM1, RBM38, and CD164. Functional follow-up of RBM38 delineates a key role for this gene in the alternative splicing program occurring during terminal erythropoiesis. Finally, we provide evidence for how common GWAS-nominated variants can disrupt cell-type-specific transcriptional regulatory pathways.',

    Description: 'A review on the effect of donor-to-donor variation on red blood cell storage lesion.',
    Abstract:
      'Although the molecular pathways leading to the progressive deterioration of stored red blood cells (RBC storage lesion) and the clinical relevance of storage-induced changes remain uncertain, substantial donor-specific variability in RBC performance during storage, and posttransfusion has been established ("donor-variation effect"). In-bag hemolysis and numerous properties of the RBC units that may affect transfusion efficacy have proved to be strongly donor-specific. Donor-variation effect may lead to the production of highly unequal blood labile products even when similar storage strategy and duration are applied. Genetic, undiagnosed/subclinical medical conditions and lifestyle factors that affect RBC characteristics at baseline, including RBC lifespan, energy metabolism, and sensitivity to oxidative stress, are all likely to influence the storage capacity of individual donors\' cells, although not evident by the donor\'s health or hematological status at blood donation. Consequently, baseline characteristics of the donors, such as membrane peroxiredoxin-2 and serum uric acid concentration, have been proposed as candidate biomarkers of storage quality. This review article focuses on specific factors that might contribute to the donor-variation effect and emphasizes the emerging need for using omics-based technologies in association with in vitro and in vivo transfusion models and clinical trials to discover biomarkers of storage quality and posttransfusion recovery in donor blood.',

Recently, genome-scale models of metabolism have been shown to provide insight into the mechanistic link between drug therapies and systems-level off-target effects while being expanded to explicitly include the three-dimensional structure of proteins. The integration of these molecular-level details, such as the physical, structural, and dynamical properties of proteins, notably expands the computational description of biochemical network-level properties and the possibility of understanding and predicting whole cell phenotypes. In this study, we present a multi-scale modeling framework that describes biological processes which range in scale from atomistic details to an entire metabolic network. Using this approach, we can understand how genetic variation, which impacts the structure and reactivity of a protein, influences both native and drug-induced metabolic states. As a proof-of-concept, we study three enzymes (catechol-O-methyltransferase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and their respective genetic variants which have clinically relevant associations. Using all-atom molecular dynamic simulations enables the sampling of long timescale conformational dynamics of the proteins (and their mutant variants) in complex with their respective native metabolites or drug molecules.

      'Within the framework of the AltitudeOmics study, erythrocytes were collected from 21 healthy volunteers at sea level, after exposure to high altitude (5260 m) for 1, 7, and 16 days, and following reascent after 7 days at 1525 m and metabolically profiled.',
    Abstract:
      'Red blood cells (RBCs) are key players in systemic oxygen transport. RBCs respond to in vitro hypoxia through the so-called oxygen-dependent metabolic regulation, which involves the competitive binding of deoxyhemoglobin and glycolytic enzymes to the N-terminal cytosolic domain of band 3. This mechanism promotes the accumulation of 2,3-DPG, stabilizing the deoxygenated state of hemoglobin, and cytosol acidification, triggering oxygen off-loading through the Bohr effect. Despite in vitro studies, in vivo adaptations to hypoxia have not yet been completely elucidated. Within the framework of the AltitudeOmics study, erythrocytes were collected from 21 healthy volunteers at sea level, after exposure to high altitude (5260 m) for 1, 7, and 16 days, and following reascent after 7 days at 1525 m. UHPLC-MS metabolomics results were correlated to physiological and athletic performance parameters. Immediate metabolic adaptations were noted as early as a few hours from ascending to >5000 m, and maintained for 16 days at high altitude. Consistent with the mechanisms elucidated in vitro, hypoxia promoted glycolysis and deregulated the pentose phosphate pathway, as well purine catabolism, glutathione homeostasis, arginine/nitric oxide, and sulfur/H2S metabolism. Metabolic adaptations were preserved 1 week after descent, consistently with improved physical performances in comparison to the first ascendance, suggesting a mechanism of metabolic memory.',

RBCs respond to in vitro hypoxia through the\n                 so-called oxygen-dependent metabolic regulation, which\n                 involves the competitive binding of deoxyhemoglobin and\n                 glycolytic enzymes to the N-terminal cytosolic domain of band\n                 3. This mechanism promotes the accumulation of 2,3-DPG,\n                 stabilizing the deoxygenated state of hemoglobin, and cytosol\n                 acidification, triggering oxygen off-loading through the Bohr\n                 effect. Despite in vitro studies, in vivo adaptations to\n                 hypoxia have not yet been completely elucidated. Within the\n                 framework of the AltitudeOmics study, erythrocytes were\n                 collected from 21 healthy volunteers at sea level, after\n                 exposure to high altitude (5260 m) for 1, 7, and 16 days, and\n                 following reascent after 7 days at 1525 m.

    Abstract:
      'Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive signalling lipid highly enriched in mature erythrocytes, with unknown functions pertaining to erythrocyte physiology. Here by employing nonbiased high-throughput metabolomic profiling, we show that erythrocyte S1P levels rapidly increase in 21 healthy lowland volunteers at 5,260\u2009m altitude on day 1 and continue increasing to 16 days with concurrently elevated erythrocyte sphingonisne kinase 1 (Sphk1) activity and haemoglobin (Hb) oxygen (O2) release capacity. Mouse genetic studies show that elevated erythrocyte Sphk1-induced S1P protects against tissue hypoxia by inducing O2 release. Mechanistically, we show that intracellular S1P promotes deoxygenated Hb anchoring to the membrane, enhances the release of membrane-bound glycolytic enzymes to the cytosol, induces glycolysis and thus the production of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG), an erythrocyte-specific glycolytic intermediate, which facilitates O2 release. Altogether, we reveal S1P as an intracellular hypoxia-responsive biolipid promoting erythrocyte glycolysis, O2 delivery and thus new therapeutic opportunities to counteract tissue hypoxia.',

    Description:
      'This study shows that reversible oxidation of GAPDH promotes metabolic reprogramming of stored RBCs and that storage-induced redox imbalance promotes vesiculation of irreversibly oxidized GAPDH.',
    Abstract:
      'Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) plays a key regulatory function in glucose oxidation by mediating fluxes through glycolysis or the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in an oxidative stress-dependent fashion. Previous studies documented metabolic reprogramming in stored red blood cells (RBCs) and oxidation of GAPDH at functional residues upon exposure to pro-oxidants diamide and H2O2 Here we hypothesize that routine storage of erythrocyte concentrates promotes metabolic modulation of stored RBCs by targeting functional thiol residues of GAPDH. Progressive increases in PPP/glycolysis ratios were determined via metabolic flux analysis after spiking (13)C1,2,3-glucose in erythrocyte concentrates stored in Additive Solution-3 under blood bank conditions for up to 42 days. Proteomics analyses revealed a storage-dependent oxidation of GAPDH at functional Cys152, 156, 247, and His179. Activity loss by oxidation occurred with increasing storage duration and was progressively irreversible. Irreversibly oxidized GAPDH accumulated in stored erythrocyte membranes and supernatants through storage day 42. By combining state-of-the-art ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolic flux analysis with redox and switch-tag proteomics, we identify for the first time ex vivo functionally relevant reversible and irreversible (sulfinic acid; Cys to dehydroalanine) oxidations of GAPDH without exogenous supplementation of excess pro-oxidant compounds in clinically relevant blood products. Oxidative and metabolic lesions, exacerbated by storage under hyperoxic conditions, were ameliorated by hypoxic storage. Storage-dependent reversible oxidation of GAPDH represents a mechanistic adaptation in stored erythrocytes to promote PPP activation and generate reducing equivalents. Removal of irreversibly oxidized, functionally compromised GAPDH identifies enhanced vesiculation as a self-protective mechanism in ex vivo aging erythrocytes.',

      'An exploration of the storage quality of G6PD deficient red blood cells through physiological, electron microscopy, and omics approaches.',
    Abstract:
      'Storage of packed red blood cells (RBCs) is associated with progressive accumulation of lesions, mostly triggered by energy and oxidative stresses, which potentially compromise the effectiveness of the transfusion therapy. Concerns arise as to whether glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient subjects (G6PD(-)), ~5% of the population in the Mediterranean area, should be accepted as routine donors in the light of the increased oxidative stress their RBCs suffer from. To address this question, we first performed morphology (scanning electron microscopy), physiology and omics (proteomics and metabolomics) analyses on stored RBCs from healthy or G6PD(-) donors. We then used an in vitro model of transfusion to simulate transfusion outcomes involving G6PD(-) donors or recipients, by reconstituting G6PD(-) stored or fresh blood with fresh or stored blood from healthy volunteers, respectively, at body temperature. We found that G6PD(-) cells store well in relation to energy, calcium and morphology related parameters, though at the expenses of a compromised anti-oxidant system. Additional stimuli, mimicking post-transfusion conditions (37\u00b0C, reconstitution with fresh healthy blood, incubation with oxidants) promoted hemolysis and oxidative lesions in stored G6PD(-) cells in comparison to controls. On the other hand, stored healthy RBC units showed better oxidative parameters and lower removal signaling when reconstituted with G6PD(-) fresh blood compared to control. Although the measured parameters of stored RBCs from the G6PD deficient donors appeared to be acceptable, the results from the in vitro model of transfusion suggest that G6PD(-) RBCs could be more susceptible to hemolysis and oxidative stresses post-transfusion. On the other hand, their chronic exposure to oxidative stress might make them good recipients, as they better tolerate exposure to oxidatively damaged long stored healthy RBCs.',

    Description: 'The use of targeted proteomics to identify biomarkers of the red blood cell storage lesion.',
    Abstract:
      'Laboratory technologies have highlighted the progressive accumulation of the so-called "storage lesion," a wide series of alterations to stored red blood cells (RBCs) that may affect the safety and effectiveness of the transfusion therapy. New improvements in the field are awaited to ameliorate this lesion, such as the introduction of washing technologies in the cell processing pipeline. Laboratory studies that have tested such technologies so far rely on observational qualitative or semiquantitative techniques. A state-of-the-art quantitative proteomics approach utilizing quantitative concatamers (QconCAT) was used to simultaneously monitor fluctuations in the abundance of 114 proteins in AS-3 RBC supernatants (n\u2009=\u20095; 11 time points, including before and after leukoreduction, at 3 hours, on Days 1 and 2, and weekly sampling from Day 7 through Day 42). Leukoreduction-dependent depletion of plasma proteins was observed at the earliest time points. A subset of proteins showed very high linear correlation (r(2) \u2009>\u20090.9) not only with storage time, but also with absolute levels of hemoglobin \u03b11 and \u03b2, a proxy for RBC hemolysis and vesiculation. Linear regression was performed to describe the temporal relationship between these proteins. Our findings suggest a role for supernatant glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; peroxiredoxin-1, -2, and -6; carbonic anhydrase-1 and -2; selenium binding protein-1; biliverdin reductase; aminolevulinate dehydratase; and catalase as potential biomarkers of RBC quality during storage.

New improvements in the field are awaited\n                 to ameliorate this lesion, such as the introduction of washing\n                 technologies in the cell processing pipeline. Laboratory\n                 studies that have tested such technologies so far rely on\n                 observational qualitative or semiquantitative techniques.\n                 STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A state-of-the-art quantitative\n                 proteomics approach utilizing quantitative concatamers\n                 (QconCAT) was used to simultaneously monitor fluctuations in\n                 the abundance of 114 proteins in AS-3 RBC supernatants (n = 5;\n                 11 time points, including before and after leukoreduction, at\n                 3 hours, on Days 1 and 2, and weekly sampling from Day 7\n                 through Day 42). RESULTS: Leukoreduction-dependent depletion\n                 of plasma proteins was observed at the earliest time points. A\n                 subset of proteins showed very high linear correlation (r(2) >\n                 0.9) not only with storage time, but also with absolute levels\n                 of hemoglobin $\\alpha$1 and $\\beta$, a proxy for RBC hemolysis\n                 and vesiculation.

    Abstract:
      'The introduction of omics technologies, in particular proteomics and metabolomics in the field of transfusion medicine, has unveiled the complexity of the storage lesion. Even though it is now universally accepted that the storage lesion affects red cell survival upon transfusion and thus, theoretically, the safety and effectiveness of the transfusion therapy, no significant association between storage duration and transfusion outcomes has been observed in any of the large-scale randomized clinical trials performed so far. This disconnection between laboratory and clinical evidence may be in part reconciled by the appreciation of the underlying biological variability among donors and recipients, utterly affecting the severity of the storage lesion and the clinical effects of the transfusion therapy. While in the last few years the transfusion community has been split between those seeing the glass half full or half empty, considerations on the influence of biological variability and prestorage variables (e.g. handling and processing) on the final quality of packed red blood cells have prompted a re-assessment of whether we do really know what is in the glass (the final blood product). Controversy persists between the supporters of the clinical irrelevance of the storage lesion and those questioning the design and statistical power of the evidence-based studies looking for a correlation between storage duration and untoward consequences of transfusion.

    Abstract:
      'Small civilian unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) are a novel way to transport small goods. To the best of our knowledge there are no studies examining the impact of drone transport on blood products, describing approaches to maintaining temperature control, or component physical characteristics during drone transport. Six leukoreduced red blood cell (RBC) and six apheresis platelet (PLT) units were split using sterile techniques. The larger parent RBC and PLT units, as well as six unthawed plasma units frozen within 24 hours of collection (FP24), were placed in a cooler, attached to the drone, and flown for up to 26.5 minutes with temperature logging. Ambient temperatures during the experimental window ranged between -1 and 18\u00b0C across 2 days. The difference between the ambient and unit temperatures was approximately 20\u00b0C for PLT and FP24 units. After flight, the RBC parent units were centrifuged and visually checked for hemolysis; the PLTs were checked for changes in mean PLT volumes (MPVs), pH, and PLT count; and the frozen air bubbles on the back of the FP24 units were examined for any changes in size or shape, as evidence of thawing. There was no evidence of RBC hemolysis; no significant changes in PLT count, pH, or MPVs; and no changes in the FP24 bubbles. The temperature of all units was maintained during transport and flight. There was no adverse impact of drone transport on RBC, PLT, or FP24 units. These findings suggest that drone transportation systems are a viable option for the transportation of blood products.',

      'The introduction of omics technologies in the field of Transfusion Medicine has significantly advanced our understanding of the red cell storage lesion. While the clinical relevance of such a lesion is still a matter of debate, quantitative and redox proteomics approaches, as well quantitative metabolic flux analysis and metabolic tracing experiments promise to revolutionise our understanding of the role of blood processing strategies, inform the design and testing of novel additives or technologies (such as pathogen reduction), and evaluate the clinical relevance of donor and recipient biological variability with respect to red cell storability and transfusion outcomes. By reviewing existing literature in this rapidly expanding research endeavour, we highlight for the first time a correlation between metabolic markers of the red cell storage age and protein markers of haemolysis. Finally, we introduce the concept of metabolic linkage, i.e. the appreciation of a network of highly correlated small molecule metabolites which results from biochemical constraints of erythrocyte metabolic enzyme activities. For the foreseeable future, red cell studies will advance Transfusion Medicine and haematology by addressing the alteration of metabolic linkage phenotypes in response to stimuli, including, but not limited to, storage additives, enzymopathies (e.g. glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency), hypoxia, sepsis or haemorrhage.',

    Description:
      'A review that discusses the role and mechanisms of adenosine, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and sphingosine 1-phosphate in the acute adaptation of humans to high-altitude hypoxia.',
    Abstract:
      'Erythrocytes are vital to human adaptation under hypoxic conditions because of their abundance in number and irreplaceable function of delivering oxygen (O2). However, although multiple large-scale altitude studies investigating the overall coordination of the human body for hypoxia adaptation have been conducted, detailed research with a focus on erythrocytes was missing due to lack of proper techniques. The recently maturing metabolomics profiling technology appears to be the answer to this limitation. Metabolomics profiling provides unbiased high-throughput screening data that reveal the overall metabolic status of erythrocytes. Recent studies have exploited this new technology and provided novel insight into erythrocyte physiology and pathology. In particular, a series of studies focusing on erythrocyte purinergic signaling have reported that adenosine signaling, coupled with 5\' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the production of erythrocyte-enriched bioactive signaling lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate, regulate erythrocyte glucose metabolism for more O2 delivery. Moreover, an adenosine-dependent "erythrocyte hypoxic memory" was discovered that provides an explanation for fast acclimation upon re-ascent. These findings not only shed new light on our understanding of erythrocyte function and hypoxia adaptation, but also offer a myriad of novel therapeutic possibilities to counteract various hypoxic conditions.',

    Description: 'An investigation of whether RBC distribution width is associated with morbidity or mortality in critically ill children.',
    Abstract:
      'RBC distribution width is reported to be an independent predictor of outcome in adults with a variety of conditions. We sought to determine if RBC distribution width is associated with morbidity or mortality in critically ill children. We collected demographics, laboratory values, hospitalization characteristics, and outcomes. We calculated the relative change in RBC distribution width from admission RBC distribution width to the highest RBC distribution width during the first 7 days of hospitalization. Our primary outcome was ICU mortality or use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a composite. Secondary outcomes were ICU- and ventilator-free days. We identified 3,913 eligible subjects with an estimated mortality (by Pediatric Index of Mortality 2) of 2.94% \u00b1 9.25% and an actual ICU mortality of 2.91%. For the study cohort, admission RBC distribution width was 14.12% \u00b1 1.89% and relative change in RBC distribution width was 2.63% \u00b1 6.23%. On univariate analysis, both admission RBC distribution width and relative change in RBC distribution width correlated with mortality or the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (odds ratio, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.12-1.27] and odds ratio, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.04-1.08], respectively; p < 0.001). After adjusting for confounding variables, including severity of illness, both admission RBC distribution width (odds ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.24) and relative change in RBC distribution width (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07) remained independently associated with ICU mortality or the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Admission RBC distribution width and relative change in RBC distribution width both weakly correlated with fewer ICU- (r = 0.038) and ventilator-free days (r = 0.05) (p < 0.001). Independent of illness severity in critically ill children, admission RBC distribution width is associated with ICU mortality and morbidity. These data suggest that RBC distribution width may be a biomarker for RBC injury that is of sufficient magnitude to influence critical illness outcome, possibly via oxygen delivery impairment.',

    Abstract:
      'Red blood cells (RBCs) are the most abundant cell type in the human body. RBCs and, in particular, their plasma membrane composition have been extensively studied for many years. During the past decade proteomics studies have extended our knowledge on RBC composition; however, these studies did not provide quantitative insights. Here we report a large-scale proteomics investigation of RBCs and their "white ghost" membrane fraction. Samples were processed using the multienzyme digestion filter-aided sample preparation (MED-FASP) and analyzed using Q-Exactive mass spectrometer. Protein abundances were computed using the total protein approach (TPA). The validation of the data with stable isotope-labeled peptide-based protein quantification followed. Our in-depth analysis resulted in the identification of 2650 proteins, of which 1890 occurred at more than 100 copies per cell. We quantified 41 membrane transporter proteins spanning an abundance range of five orders of magnitude. Some of these, including the drug transporter ABCA7 and choline transporters SLC44A1 and SLC44A2, have not previously been identified in RBC membranes. Comparison of protein copy numbers assessed by proteomics showed a good correlation with literature data; however, abundances of several proteins were not consistent with the classical references. Because we validated our findings by a targeted analysis using labeled standards, our data suggest that some older reference data from a variety of biochemical approaches are inaccurate. Our study provides the first "in-depth" quantitative analysis of the RBC proteome and will promote future studies of erythrocyte structure, functions, and disease.',

    Description: 'Quantitative tracing experiments show that human red blood cells can metabolize carbon sources other than glucose.',
    Abstract:
      'Red blood cells (RBCs) are thought to have a relatively simple metabolic network compared to other human cell types. Recent proteomics reports challenge the notion that RBCs are mere hemoglobin carriers with limited metabolic activity. Expanding our understanding of RBC metabolism has key implications in many biomedical areas, including transfusion medicine. In-gel digestion coupled with mass spectrometric analysis proteomics approaches were combined with state-of-the-art tracing experiments by incubating leukofiltered RBCs in additive solution-3 for up to 42 days under blood bank conditions, in presence of 13 C1,2,3 -glucose, 2,2,4,4-d-citrate, and 13 C,15 N-glutamine. Results indicate that the pentose phosphate pathway/glycolysis ratio increases during storage in additive solution-3. While the majority of supernatant glucose is consumed to fuel glycolysis, incorporation of glucose-derived pentose phosphate moieties was observed in nucleoside monophosphates. Incubation with deuterated citrate indicated that citrate uptake and metabolism contribute to explain the origin of up to approximately 20% to 30% lactate that could not be explained by glucose oxidation and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate consumption alone. Incubation with 13 C,15 N-glutamine showed that glutaminolysis fuels transamination reactions and accumulation of millimolar levels of 5-oxoproline, while de novo glutathione synthesis was not significantly active during refrigerated storage. Quantitative tracing metabolic experiments revealed that mature RBCs can metabolize other substrates than glucose, such as citrate, an observation relevant to transfusion medicine (i.e., formulation of novel additives), and other research endeavors where metabolic modulation of RBCs opens potential avenues for therapeutic interventions, such as in sickle cell disease.',

    Abstract:
      'Red blood cell storage in the blood bank makes millions of units of available for transfusion to civilian and military recipients every year. From glass bottles to plastic bags, from anticoagulants to complex additives, from whole blood to leukocyte filtered packed red blood cells: huge strides have been made in the field of blood component processing and storage in the blood bank during the last century. Still, refrigerated preservation of packed red blood cells under blood bank conditions results in the progressive accumulation of a wide series of biochemical and morphological changes to the stored erythrocytes, collectively referred to as the storage lesion(s). Approximately ten years ago, retrospective clinical evidence had suggested that such lesion(s) may be clinically relevant and mediate some of the untoward transfusion-related effects observed especially in some categories of recipients at risk (e.g. massively or chronically transfused recipients). Since then, randomized clinical trials have failed to prospectively detect any signal related to red cell storage duration and increased morbidity and mortality in several categories of recipients, at the limits of the statistical power of these studies. While a good part of the transfusion community has immediately adopted the take-home message "if it isn\'t broken, don\'t fix it" (i.e. no change to the standard of practice should be pursued), decision makers have been further questioning whether there may be room for further improvements in this field. Provocatively, we argue that consensus has yet to be unanimously reached on what makes a good quality marker of the red cell storage lesion and transfusion safety/efficacy. In other words, if it is true that "you can\'t manage what you can\'t measure", then future advancements in the field of transfusion medicine will necessarily rely on state of the art analytical omics technologies of well-defined quality parameters. Heavily borrowing from Douglas Adam\'s imaginary repertoire from the world famous "Hitchhiker\'s guide to the galaxy", we briefly summarize how some of the principles for intergalactic hitchhikers may indeed apply to inform navigation through the complex universe of red cell storage quality, safety and efficacy.',

    Abstract:
      "Red blood cells (RBC) are the most abundant host cells in the human body. Mature erythrocytes are devoid of nuclei and organelles and have always been regarded as circulating 'bags of hemoglobin'. The advent of proteomics has challenged this assumption, revealing unanticipated complexity and novel roles for RBCs not just in gas transport, but also in systemic metabolic homeostasis in health and disease. Areas covered: In this review we will summarize the main advancements in the field of discovery mode and redox/quantitative proteomics with respect to RBC biology. We thus focus on translational/clinical applications, such as transfusion medicine, hematology (e.g. hemoglobinopathies) and personalized medicine. Synergy of omics technologies - especially proteomics and metabolomics - are highlighted as a hallmark of clinical metabolomics applications for the foreseeable future. Expert commentary: The introduction of advanced proteomics technologies, especially quantitative and redox proteomics, and the integration of proteomics data with omics information gathered through orthogonal technologies (especially metabolomics) promise to revolutionize many biomedical areas, from hematology and transfusion medicine to personalized medicine and clinical biochemistry.",

    Description: 'Quantitative metabolomics data for human red blood cells under various temperatures.',
    Abstract:
      'The temperature dependence of biological processes has been studied at the levels of individual biochemical reactions and organism physiology (e.g., basal metabolic rates) but has not been examined at the metabolic network level. Here, we used a systems biology approach to characterize the temperature dependency of the human red blood cell (RBC) metabolic network between 4C and 37C through absolutely quantified exo- and endo-metabolomics data. We used an Arrhenius-type model (Q10) to describe how the rate of a biochemical process changes with every 10C change in temperature. Multivariate statistical analysis of the metabolomics data revealed that the same metabolic network-level trends previously reported for RBCs at 4C were conserved but accelerated with increasing temperature. We calculated a median Q10 coefficient of 2.89+\\-1.03 for 48 individual metabolite concentrations, within the expected range of 2-3 for biological processes. We then integrated these metabolomics measurements into a cell-scale metabolic model to study pathway usage, calculating a median Q10 coefficient of 2.73+\\-0.75 for 35 reaction fluxes. The relative fluxes through glycolysis and nucleotide metabolism pathways were consistent across the studied temperature range despite the non-uniform distributions of Q10 coefficients of individual metabolites and reaction fluxes. Together, these results indicate that the rate of change of network-level responses to temperature differences in RBC metabolism is consistent between 4C and 37C. More broadly, we provide a baseline characterization of a biochemical network given no transcriptional or translational regulation that can be used to explore the temperature dependence of metabolism.',

Here, we used a\n                 systems biology approach to characterize the temperature\n                 dependency of the human red blood cell (RBC) metabolic network\n                 between 4C and 37C through absolutely quantified exo- and\n                 endo-metabolomics data. We used an Arrhenius-type model (Q10)\n                 to describe how the rate of a biochemical process changes with\n                 every 10C change in temperature. Multivariate statistical\n                 analysis of the metabolomics data revealed that the same\n                 metabolic network-level trends previously reported for RBCs at\n                 4C were conserved but accelerated with increasing temperature.\n                 We calculated a median Q10 coefficient of\n                 2.89+\\textbackslash-1.03 for 48 individual metabolite\n                 concentrations, within the expected range of 2-3 for\n                 biological processes. We then integrated these metabolomics\n                 measurements into a cell-scale metabolic model to study\n                 pathway usage, calculating a median Q10 coefficient of\n                 2.73+\\textbackslash-0.75 for 35 reaction fluxes. The relative\n                 fluxes through glycolysis and nucleotide metabolism pathways\n                 were consistent across the studied temperature range despite\n                 the non-uniform distributions of Q10 coefficients of\n                 individual metabolites and reaction fluxes. Together, these\n                 results indicate that the rate of change of network-level\n                 responses to temperature differences in RBC metabolism is\n                 consistent between 4C and 37C.

    Abstract:
      'Storage of red blood cells (RBCs) under blood bank conditions promotes metabolic modulation within the RBC. This "metabolic storage lesion" may affect the quality and safety of the transfused RBCs. The aim of this study is to determine the metabolic changes in stored RBCs over 42 days of routine storage followed by a US Food and Drug Administration-approved method of rejuvenation, freezing, and preparation for transfusion. We exploited a mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach to monitor 42-day-stored citrate phosphate dextrose/AS-1 RBCs (n\u2009=\u200929) that were rejuvenated, glycerolized and frozen, then thawed and deglycerolized, and held for 24 hours at 1 to 6\u00baC in saline-glucose. Previously reported metabolic alterations were confirmed in 42-day-old RBCs. In this study, in total, 181 (62%) of the biochemical compounds exhibited significant (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05) change compared with Day 0 values. Rejuvenation restored adenosine triphosphate and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate levels, replenished purine reservoirs, up regulated glycolysis, increased levels of pentose phosphate pathway intermediates, and partially rescued glutathione biosynthesis. Increased levels of lysophospholipid in rejuvenated RBCs suggests the activation of recycling pathways of damaged membrane lipids, in which a total of 167 (57%) biochemical compounds showed significant change compared with Day 42 values. Rejuvenation reversed over one-half of the metabolic biochemical compounds evaluated compared with Day 42 values, and the compounds were stable through frozen storage and preparation for transfusion. Rejuvenation promoted significant metabolic reprogramming, including the reactivation of energy-generating and antioxidant pathways (the pentose phosphate pathway and glutathione homeostasis), salvage reactions, cofactor reservoirs, and membrane lipid recycling.',

      'Alternate sugar metabolism during red blood cell (RBC) storage is not well understood. Here we report fructose and mannose metabolism in RBCs during cold storage in SAGM and the impact that these monosaccharides have on metabolic biomarkers of RBC storage lesion. RBCs were stored in SAGM containing uniformly labeled 13 C-fructose or 13 C-mannose at 9 or 18 mmol/L concentration for 25 days. RBCs and media were sampled at 14 time points during storage and analyzed using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Blood banking quality assurance measurements were performed. Red blood cells incorporated fructose and mannose during cold storage in the presence of glucose. Mannose was metabolized in preference to glucose via glycolysis. Fructose lowered adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and contributed little to ATP maintenance when added to SAGM. Both monosaccharides form the advanced glycation end product glycerate. Mannose activates enzymes in the RBC that take part in glycan synthesis. Fructose or mannose addition to RBC SAGM concentrates may not offset the shift in metabolism of RBCs that occurs after 10 days of storage. Fructose and mannose metabolism at 4\u00b0C in SAGM reflects their metabolism at physiologic temperature. Glycerate excretion is a measure of protein deglycosylation activity in stored RBCs. No cytoprotective effect was observed upon the addition of either fructose or mannose to SAGM.',

RBCs and media were sampled at 14 time points\n                 during storage and analyzed using ultraperformance liquid\n                 chromatography-mass spectrometry. Blood banking quality\n                 assurance measurements were performed. RESULTS: Red blood\n                 cells incorporated fructose and mannose during cold storage in\n                 the presence of glucose. Mannose was metabolized in preference\n                 to glucose via glycolysis. Fructose lowered adenosine\n                 triphosphate (ATP) levels and contributed little to ATP\n                 maintenance when added to SAGM. Both monosaccharides form the\n                 advanced glycation end product glycerate. Mannose activates\n                 enzymes in the RBC that take part in glycan synthesis.\n                 CONCLUSIONS: Fructose or mannose addition to RBC SAGM\n                 concentrates may not offset the shift in metabolism of RBCs\n                 that occurs after 10 days of storage. Fructose and mannose\n                 metabolism at 4\u00b0C in SAGM reflects their metabolism at\n                 physiologic temperature. Glycerate excretion is a measure of\n                 protein deglycosylation activity in stored RBCs. No\n                 cytoprotective effect was observed upon the addition of either\n                 fructose or mannose to SAGM.",\n  journal     = "Transfusion",\n  volume      =  57,\n  number      =  11,\n  pages       = "2665--2676",\n  month       =  nov,\n  year        =  2017,\n  language    = "en"\n}\n',

    Abstract:
      'The objectives of this 2-phase study were to elucidate pharmacokinetics (PK), in vivo 24-hour recovery, and red blood cell (RBC) survival properties of RBC-encapsulated dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DSP) prepared using the EryDex System (EDS). The 24-hour RBC recovery and T50 survival phase studied subjects were randomized to receive autologous RBCs loaded with either 15-20 mg DSP (Group 1A) or sham saline (Group 2A). Loaded RBCs were radiolabeled with 51-Cr, and the labeled RBCs were followed over time in vivo. The PK phase evaluated dose levels of 2.5-5 mg (Group 1B) and 15-20 mg (Group 2B) DSP encapsulated in RBCs infused into healthy randomized subjects. The mean \u00b1 SD 24-hour RBC recovery was 77.9% \u00b1 3.3% and 72.7% \u00b1 10.5% for Groups 1A and 2A, respectively. The mean \u00b1 SD RBC life span was 84.3 \u00b1 8.3 days in Group 1A and 88.9 \u00b1 6.2 days in Group 2A. The PK phase actual DSP loading doses (mean \u00b1 SEM) were 4.2 \u00b1 0.27 mg and 16.9 \u00b1 0.90 mg in Groups 1B and 2B, respectively. Release of dexamethasone from RBCs in vivo peaked at 1 hour, and a sustained release of dexamethasone could be detected until 35 days after the single intravenous infusion in Group 2B. The mean RBC in vivo recovery for DSP-loaded processed cells compares similarly to the 24-hour recovery of regulated RBC products intended for transfusion. There was a minimal but acceptable adverse impact on the survival of EDS-processed RBCs. DSP-loaded autologous RBCs, prepared using the EDS, delivered a sustained dose of dexamethasone in vivo.',

      "Metabolomics studies have revealed transition points in metabolic signatures of red cells during storage in SAGM, whose clinical significance is unclear. We set out to investigate whether these transition points occur independent of storage media and define differences in the metabolism of red cells in additive solutions. Red cell concentrates were stored in SAGM, AS-1, AS-3 or PAGGSM, and sampled fourteen times spanning Day 1-46. Following quality control, the samples were split into extracellular and intracellular aliquots. These were analysed with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry analysis affording quantitative metabolic profiles of both intra- and extracellular red cell metabolites. Differences were observed in glycolysis, purine salvage, glutathione synthesis and citrate metabolism on account of the storage solutions. Donor variability however hindered the accurate characterization of metabolic transition time-points. Intracellular citrate concentrations were increased in red cells stored in AS-3 and PAGGSM media. The metabolism of citrate in red cells in SAGM was subsequently confirmed using 13 C citrate isotope labelling and shown to originate from citrate anticoagulant. Metabolic signatures that discriminate between 'fresh' and 'old' stored red cells are dependent upon additive solutions. Specifically, the incorporation and metabolism of citrate in additive solutions with lower chloride ion concentration is altered and impacts glycolysis.",

    Abstract:
      'A great deal of interest has been attracted by back-of-the-envelope calculations suggesting that bacterial cells (recently revised to be ~3.9\u00d71013) outnumber the total number of host cells in the human body (3.0\u00d71013, estimated for a 70 kg \u201creference man\u201d). Although early estimates of ~2.8\u00d71013 red blood cells (RBC) in adult humans seem excessive in comparison to these numbers, it is universally accepted that RBC constitute the most abundant cell type in the body (~2.5\u00d71013) in foetal and post-natal life. With an average lifespan of 120 days in circulation, every day ~2\u00d71011 RBC are continuously cleared/released in the blood stream. However, mature RBC are devoid of nuclei and organelles and each mature RBC contains ~270\u00d7106 molecules of haemoglobin, accounting for approximately 90% of its dry weight. It is not, therefore, surprising that RBC have been almost exclusively viewed as simple biological envelopes for circulating haemoglobin, in the light of their lack of nuclei and organelles and their clear and unique role in oxygen transport and gas homeostasis functions.',

    Description:
      'Review of current practices in red blood cell transfusion, outlines importance of transfusion medicine in healthcare (85 million RBC units transfused worldwide annually, 12-16 million in US).',
    Abstract:
      'Red blood cells (RBCs) units are the most requested transfusion product worldwide. Indications for transfusion include symptomatic anaemia, acute sickle cell crisis, and acute blood loss of more than 30% of the blood volume, with the aim of restoring tissue oxygen delivery. However, stored RBCs from donors are not a qualitative equal product, and, in many ways, this is a matter of concern in the transfusion practice. Besides donor-to-donor variation, the storage time influences the RBC unit at the qualitative level, as RBCs age in the storage bag and are exposed to the so-called storage lesion. Several studies have shown that the storage lesion leads to post-transfusion enhanced clearance, plasma transferrin saturation, nitric oxide scavenging and/or immunomodulation with potential unwanted transfusion-related clinical outcomes, such as acute lung injury or higher mortality rate. While, to date, several studies have claimed the risk or deleterious effects of "old" vs "young" RBC transfusion regimes, it is still a matter of debate, and consideration should be taken of the clinical context. Transfusion-dependent patients may benefit from transfusion with "young" RBC units, as it assures longer inter-transfusion periods, while transfusion with "old" RBC units is not itself harmful. Unbiased Omics approaches are being applied to the characterisation of RBC through storage, to better understand the (patho)physiological role of microparticles (MPs) that are found naturally, and also on stored RBC units. Perhaps RBC storage time is not an accurate surrogate for RBC quality and there is a need to establish which parameters do indeed reflect optimal efficacy and safety. A better Omics characterisation of components of "young" and "old" RBC units, including MPs, donor and recipient, might lead to the development of new therapies, including the use of engineered RBCs or MPs as cell-based drug delivering tools, or cost-effective personalised transfusion strategies.',

Indications for transfusion\n                 include symptomatic anaemia, acute sickle cell crisis, and\n                 acute blood loss of more than 30\\% of the blood volume, with\n                 the aim of restoring tissue oxygen delivery. However, stored\n                 RBCs from donors are not a qualitative equal product, and, in\n                 many ways, this is a matter of concern in the transfusion\n                 practice. Besides donor-to-donor variation, the storage time\n                 influences the RBC unit at the qualitative level, as RBCs age\n                 in the storage bag and are exposed to the so-called storage\n                 lesion. Several studies have shown that the storage lesion\n                 leads to post-transfusion enhanced clearance, plasma\n                 transferrin saturation, nitric oxide scavenging and/or\n                 immunomodulation with potential unwanted transfusion-related\n                 clinical outcomes, such as acute lung injury or higher\n                 mortality rate. While, to date, several studies have claimed\n                 the risk or deleterious effects of ``old'' vs ``young'' RBC\n                 transfusion regimes, it is still a matter of debate, and\n                 consideration should be taken of the clinical context.\n                 Transfusion-dependent patients may benefit from transfusion\n                 with ``young'' RBC units, as it assures longer\n                 inter-transfusion periods, while transfusion with ``old'' RBC\n                 units is not itself harmful.

      'An investigation of how hypoxia in vivo and in vitro promotes consumption of citrate and other carboxylates through the use of both carbon- and/or nitrogen-labeled glucose, citrate, glutamine, and aspartate.',
    Abstract:
      'State-of-the-art proteomics technologies have recently helped to elucidate the unanticipated complexity of red blood cell metabolism. One recent example is citrate metabolism, which is catalyzed by cytosolic isoforms of Krebs cycle enzymes that are present and active in mature erythrocytes and was determined using quantitative metabolic flux analysis. In previous studies, we reported significant increases in glycolytic fluxes in red blood cells exposed to hypoxia in vitro or in vivo, an observation relevant to transfusion medicine owing to the potential benefits associated with hypoxic storage of packed red blood cells. Here, using a combination of steady state and quantitative tracing metabolomics experiments with 13C1,2,3-glucose, 13C6-citrate, 13C515N2-glutamine, and 13C1-aspartate via ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled on line with mass spectrometry, we observed that hypoxia in vivo and in vitro promotes consumption of citrate and other carboxylates. These metabolic reactions are theoretically explained by the activity of cytosolic malate dehydrogenase 1 and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (abundantly represented in the red blood cell proteome), though moonlighting functions of additional enzymes cannot be ruled out. These observations enhance understanding of red blood cell metabolic responses to hypoxia, which could be relevant to understand systemic physiological and pathological responses to high altitude, ischemia, hemorrhage, sepsis, pulmonary hypertension, or hemoglobinopathies. Results from this study will also inform the design and testing of novel additive solutions that optimize red blood cell storage under oxygen-controlled conditions.',

    Description:
      'An exploration of the open and important question regarding the clinical relevance of hypoxanthine levels in the storage medium, showing an inverse correlation with post-transfusion recovery rates in mice and humans.',
    Abstract:
      'Hypoxanthine catabolism in vivo is potentially dangerous as it fuels production of urate and, most importantly, hydrogen peroxide. However, it is unclear whether accumulation of intracellular and supernatant hypoxanthine in stored RBC units is clinically relevant for transfused recipients. Leukoreduced RBCs from G6PD-normal or -deficient human volunteers were stored in AS-3 under normoxic, hyperoxic, or hypoxic conditions (with SO2 ranging from <3 to >95%). RBCs from healthy human volunteers were also collected at sea level or after 1-7 days at high altitude (>5000m). Finally, C57BL/6J mouse RBCs were incubated in vitro with 13C1-aspartate or 13C5-adenosine under normoxic or hypoxic conditions, with or without deoxycoformicin, a purine deaminase inhibitor. Metabolomics analyses were performed on human and mouse RBCs stored for up to 42 or 14 days, respectively, and correlated with 24h post-transfusion RBC recovery studies. Hypoxanthine increased in stored RBC units as a function of oxygen levels. Stored RBCs from human G6PD-deficient donors had higher levels of deaminated purines. Hypoxia in vitro and in vivo decreased purine oxidation and enhanced purine salvage reactions in human and mouse RBCs, which was partly explained by decreased AMP deaminase activity. In addition, hypoxanthine levels negatively correlated with post-transfusion RBC recovery in mice and - preliminarily albeit significantly - in humans. In conclusion, hypoxanthine is an in vitro metabolic marker of the RBC storage lesion that negatively correlates with post-transfusion recovery in vivo. Storage-dependent hypoxanthine accumulation is ameliorated by hypoxia-induced decreases in purine deamination reaction rates.',

    Abstract:
      "Transfusion of stored blood is regarded as one of the great advances in modern medicine. However, during storage in the blood bank, red blood cells (RBCs) undergo a series of biochemical and biomechanical changes that affect cell morphology and physiology and potentially impair transfusion safety and efficacy. Despite reassuring evidence from clinical trials, it is universally accepted that the storage lesion(s) results in the altered physiology of long-stored RBCs and helps explain the rapid clearance of up to one-fourth of long-stored RBCs from the recipient's bloodstream at 24 hours after administration. These considerations explain the importance of understanding and mitigating the storage lesion. With the emergence of new technologies that have enabled large-scale and in-depth screening of the RBC metabolome and proteome, recent studies have provided novel insights into the molecule-level metabolic changes underpinning the accumulation of storage lesions to RBCs in the blood bank and alternative storage strategies to mitigate such lesion(s). These approaches borrow from recent insights on the biochemistry of RBC adaptation to high altitude hypoxia. We recently conducted investigations in genetically modified mice and revealed novel insights into the role of adenosine signalling in response to hypoxia as a previously unrecognised cascade regulating RBC glucose metabolism and increasing O2 release, while decreasing inflammation and tissue injuries in animal models. Here, we will discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of purinergic molecules, including adenosine and adenosine triphosphate in manipulating RBCs and blood vessels in response to hypoxia. We will also speculate about new therapeutic possibilities to improve the quality of stored RBCs and the prognosis after transfusion.",

However, during storage in the\n                 blood bank, red blood cells (RBCs) undergo a series of\n                 biochemical and biomechanical changes that affect cell\n                 morphology and physiology and potentially impair transfusion\n                 safety and efficacy. Despite reassuring evidence from clinical\n                 trials, it is universally accepted that the storage lesion(s)\n                 results in the altered physiology of long-stored RBCs and\n                 helps explain the rapid clearance of up to one-fourth of\n                 long-stored RBCs from the recipient\'s bloodstream at 24 hours\n                 after administration. These considerations explain the\n                 importance of understanding and mitigating the storage lesion.\n                 With the emergence of new technologies that have enabled\n                 large-scale and in-depth screening of the RBC metabolome and\n                 proteome, recent studies have provided novel insights into the\n                 molecule-level metabolic changes underpinning the accumulation\n                 of storage lesions to RBCs in the blood bank and alternative\n                 storage strategies to mitigate such lesion(s). These\n                 approaches borrow from recent insights on the biochemistry of\n                 RBC adaptation to high altitude hypoxia. We recently conducted\n                 investigations in genetically modified mice and revealed novel\n                 insights into the role of adenosine signalling in response to\n                 hypoxia as a previously unrecognised cascade regulating RBC\n                 glucose metabolism and increasing O2 release, while decreasing\n                 inflammation and tissue injuries in animal models. Here, we\n                 will discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of\n                 purinergic molecules, including adenosine and adenosine\n                 triphosphate in manipulating RBCs and blood vessels in\n                 response to hypoxia.

    Description:
      'A study undertaken to evaluate a potential additional source of unit to unit variation in stored RBC: the role of variable percent oxygen saturation (%SO2) levels on blood quality parameters during storage.',
    Abstract:
      'Recent research focused on understanding stored red blood cell (RBC) quality has demonstrated high variability in measures of RBC function and health across units. Studies have historically linked this high variability to variations in processing, storage method, and age. More recently, a large number of studies have focused on differences in donor demographics, donor iron sufficiency, and genetic predisposition of the donor to poor storage, particularly through mechanisms of accelerated oxidative damage. A study was undertaken to evaluate a potential additional source of unit to unit variation in stored RBC: the role of variable percent oxygen saturation (%SO2) levels on blood quality parameters during storage. %SO2 data from 492 LR-RBC/AS-3 units used for internal and external collaborative research was included in the analysis. Whole blood units were processed into red blood cells, AS-3 added, leucocyte reduced, in compliance with American Association of Blood Banks guidelines. LR-RBC/AS-3 products were subsequently analysed for %SO2 levels within 3-24 hours of phlebotomy using a co-oximeter. Separately, to evaluate the impact of pre-storage as well as increasing levels of %SO2 during storage, a pool-and-split study was performed. Four units of LR-RBC/AS-3 were split 6 ways; "as is" (control), hyperoxygenated to more than 90%, and four levels of pre-storage %SO2. The units were periodically sampled up to 42 days and analysed for %SO2, pCO2, methaemoglobin, ATP, 2,3-BPG as well as with the metabolomics workflow. The measured mean %SO2 in LR-RBC/AS-3 within 24 hours of collection was 45.9\u00b117.5% with (32.7-61.0 IQR). %SO2 in all products increased to approximately 95-100% in three weeks. Measured blood quality parameters including ATP, % haemolysis, methaemoglobin, oxidised lipids, and GSH/GSSG indicated suppressed cellular metabolism and increased red cell degradation in response to higher %SO2 levels. The surprisingly high variability in starting %SO2 levels, coupled with negative impacts of high oxygen saturation on red blood cell quality indicates that oxygen levels may be an important and under-appreciated source of unit-to-unit variability in RBC quality.',

    Description: 'A review that discusses "the good, the bad, and the ugly" aspects of blood storage practices.',
    Abstract:
      'Transfusion of packed red blood cells (RBCs) is a life-saving intervention for millions of chronically or massively transfused recipients worldwide every year. After over a century of improvements, ten years ago a highly-debated retrospective clinical paper suggested the potential negative association between storage "age of blood" and transfusion outcomes. This controversial observation fuelled the debate about the potential clinical relevance of the so-called storage lesion(s), a wide series of biochemical and morphological alterations RBCs undergo during storage in the blood bank (as extensively reviewed). Ten years later, a series of comprehensive randomised clinical trials (RCTs) have come to an end, providing reassuring evidence about the lack of a detectable difference between fresh blood and standard of care at the limits of the statistical power of these studies.',

    Abstract:
      'Faster acclimatization to high altitude upon re-ascent is seen in humans; however, the molecular basis for this enhanced adaptive response is unknown. We report that in healthy lowlanders, plasma adenosine levels are rapidly induced by initial ascent to high altitude and achieved even higher levels upon re-ascent, a feature that is positively associated with quicker acclimatization. Erythrocyte equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (eENT1) levels are reduced in humans at high altitude and in mice under hypoxia. eENT1 deletion allows rapid accumulation of plasma adenosine to counteract hypoxic tissue damage in mice. Adenosine signalling via erythrocyte ADORA2B induces PKA phosphorylation, ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of eENT1. Reduced eENT1 resulting from initial hypoxia is maintained upon re-ascent in humans or re-exposure to hypoxia in mice and accounts for erythrocyte hypoxic memory and faster acclimatization. Our findings suggest that targeting identified purinergic-signalling network would enhance the hypoxia adenosine response to counteract hypoxia-induced maladaptation.',

    Abstract:
      'Transfusion decision making (TDM) in the critically ill requires consideration of: (1) anemia tolerance, which is linked to active pathology and to physiologic reserve, (2) differences in donor RBC physiology from that of native RBCs, and (3) relative risk from anemia-attributable oxygen delivery failure vs hazards of transfusion, itself. Current approaches to TDM (e.g. hemoglobin thresholds) do not: (1) differentiate between patients with similar anemia, but dissimilar pathology/physiology, and (2) guide transfusion timing and amount to efficacy-based goals (other than resolution of hemoglobin thresholds). Here, we explore approaches to TDM that address the above gaps.',

    Abstract:
      'Here we review recent data and the evolving understanding of the role of red blood cell-derived microparticles (RMPs) in normal physiology and in disease progression. Microparticles (MPs) are small membrane vesicles derived from various parent cell types. MPs are produced in response to a variety of stimuli through several cytoskeletal and membrane phospholipid changes. MPs have been investigated as potential biomarkers for multiple disease processes and are thought to have biological effects, most notably in: promotion of coagulation, production and handling of reactive oxygen species, immune modulation, angiogenesis, and in apoptosis. Specifically, RMPs are produced normally during RBC maturation and their production is accelerated during processing and storage for transfusion. Several factors during RBC storage are known to trigger RMP production, including: increased intracellular calcium, increased potassium leakage, and energy failure with ATP depletion. Of note, RMP composition differs from that of intact RBCs, and the nature and composition of RMP components are affected by both storage duration and the character of storage solutions. Recognised RMP bioactivities include: promotion of coagulation, immune modulation, and promotion of endothelial adhesion, as well as influence upon vasoregulation via nitric oxide (NO) scavenging. Of particular relevance, RMPs are more avid NO scavengers than intact RBCs and this feature has been proposed as a mechanism for the impaired oxygen delivery homeostasis that has been observed following transfusion. Preliminary human studies demonstrate that circulating RMP abundance increases with RBC transfusion and is associated with altered plasma vasoactivity and abnormal vasoregulation. In summary, RMPs are submicron particles released from stored RBCs, with demonstrated vasoactive properties that appear to disturb oxygen delivery homeostasis. The clinical impact of RMPs in transfusion recipients is an area of continued investigation.',

    Abstract:
      'Developments in assay technologies have transformed biology from a data-poor qualitative field to a data-rich quantitative field. The cost of biological data generation has exponentially decreased in the past two decades, allowing simultaneous measurement of several types of biomolecules, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites. Particularly for Transfusion Medicine, studies have generated metabolomics and proteomics data of stored red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets detailing time-dependent changes. These high-throughput, or \u201comics\u201d, datasets measure hundreds of metabolites and proteins at tens of time points for each replicate, resulting in studies with over 10,000 data points. As seen in other fields that have generated omics datasets for nearly two decades, it is apparent that data analysis and interpretation, rather than data generation, is becoming the bottleneck of biological discovery.',

      'This article provides a brief overview of the variables that contribute or potentially contribute to the quality of stored RBC components, including blood collection, processing, and donor-related variables.',
    Abstract:
      'Quality and safety of red blood cell (RBC) components is managed by screening of donors and strict regulatory controls of blood collection, processing and storage procedures. Despite these efforts, variations in RBC component quality exist as exemplified by the wide range in storage-induced haemolysis. This article provides a brief overview of the variables that contribute or potentially contribute to the quality of stored RBC components, including blood collection, processing, and donor-related variables. Particular focus is made on donor health and lifestyle factors that are not specifically screened and may impact on the physicobiochemical properties of RBCs and their storability. Inflammatory and oxidative stress states may be especially relevant as RBCs are susceptible to oxidative injury. Few studies have investigated the effect of specific donor-related variables on the quality of stored RBC components. Donor-related variables may be unaccounted confounders in the "age of blood" clinical studies that compared outcomes following transfusion of fresher or longer-stored RBC components. The conclusion is drawn that the blood donor is the greatest source of RBC component variability and the least "regulated" aspect of blood component production. It is proposed that more research is needed to better understand the connection between donor-related variables and quality consistency of stored RBC components. This could be very important given the impact of modern lifestyles that sees escalating rates of non-communicable health conditions that are associated with increased oxidative stress, such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes in children and adults, as well as an ageing population in many countries. The effect of these changes to global health and population demographics will impact on blood donor panels, and without significant new research, the consequences on the quality of stored blood components and transfusion outcomes are unknown.',
